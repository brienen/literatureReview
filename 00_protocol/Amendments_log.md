# Protocol amendments log

This document records all amendments to the review protocol that occur after the commencement of the systematic literature review. It serves as a transparent audit trail in accordance with PRISMA 2020. Amendments are documented chronologically and are not retroactively applied to earlier stages unless explicitly stated.
## Amendment entries

### Amendment A1
- **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
- **Protocol element affected:** Search strategy / information sources / eligibility criteria / screening procedure  
- **Description of change:**  
  Concise description of what was changed relative to the original protocol.
- **Rationale:**  
  Justification for the amendment, including methodological or practical considerations.
- **Stage of review:**  
  Prior to abstract screening / during abstract screening / prior to full-text eligibility assessment.
- **Impact on results:**  
  Description of potential or observed impact on the review scope, screening outcomes, or synthesis.
- **PRISMA reporting note:**  
  Description of how this amendment is reflected in the PRISMA flow diagram or Methods section.

## Guidance for use

Amendments are recorded only after the protocol has been finalized. Editorial clarifications without methodological impact are not logged. Each amendment receives a unique identifier (A1, A2, …). If an amendment introduces an additional search wave, this is reflected consistently in `search_log.xlsx`, screening outputs, and PRISMA flow reporting. This document is version-controlled and should not be rewritten retrospectively.
## Relationship to other artefacts

- [[protocol]] documents the a priori methodological design.
- [[query]] specifies the intended search logic.
- [[Query_log]] records the execution of searches.
- [[eligibility_log]] records full-text inclusion and exclusion decisions.

Together, these artefacts provide a complete and auditable account of methodological decisions.
