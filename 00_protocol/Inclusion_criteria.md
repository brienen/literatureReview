  The study explicitly addresses semantic interoperability or closely related notions such as semantic alignment, shared meaning, or semantic integration in the context of information systems or data exchange.

- **IC2 – Conceptual artefacts**  
  The study engages with conceptual or semantic artefacts, including conceptual models, information models, semantic domain models, ontologies, controlled vocabularies, or semantic standards. 

- **IC3 – Cross-organizational or cross-domain scope**  
  The study considers interoperability across organizational, institutional, or domain boundaries, or explicitly reflects on implications beyond a single system or organization.

- **IC4 – Public-sector relevance**  
  The study is situated in, or explicitly transferable to, public-sector, governmental, or policy-related contexts.

- **IC5 – Analytical contribution**  
  The study provides a substantive theoretical, conceptual, or analytical contribution, such as frameworks, classifications, typologies, design principles, or reflective analyses.

- **IC6 – Publication type**  
  The study is a peer-reviewed journal article or conference paper. Selected grey literature may be included where it provides authoritative conceptual or policy insight.

- **IC7 – Language and accessibility**  
  The study is written in English and the full text is accessible.

## Exclusion criteria

- **EC1 – Off-topic**  
  The study doe not address interoperability, or addresses interoperability without substantive discussion of semantic meaning or conceptual alignment.

- **EC2 – Tool- or implementation-only focus**  
  The study primarily describes a specific tool, platform, or implementation without deriving generalizable conceptual insights.

- **EC3 – Narrow domain specificity**  
  The study focuses on a highly specific domain, dataset, or case without addressing broader interoperability challenges or transferable concepts.

- **EC4 – Non-scholarly publication type**  
  Editorials, opinion pieces, posters, tutorials, and other non-peer-reviewed publications are excluded unless explicitly classified as supplementary grey literature.
