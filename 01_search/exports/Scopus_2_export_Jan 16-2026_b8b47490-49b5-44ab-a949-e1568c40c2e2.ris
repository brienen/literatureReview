AB  - Digital implementation of the Once-Only Principle (OOP) reduces the administrative burden of accessing public services and enhances public administration performance. It also facilitates the mobility of citizens and businesses within the European Union through legal and effective EU-wide evidence. However, despite the existence of several semantic standards, a lack of an ontology for EU-wide evidence persists, primarily due to the low level of EU harmonisation of information that may prove compliance with procedural requirements. Building EU-wide evidence involves several cross-border communities of practice, composed of experts with different technical, legal, organisational, semantic, idiomatic and cultural backgrounds, spanning various public administration levels and sectors. This diversity introduces a range of cross-border, socio-technical challenges that have not been directly addressed in existing literature or by European projects and initiatives. Based on the lessons learned from the Digital Europe for All (DE4A) large-scale pilot project, the DE4A EU-wide OOP Semantic Elicitation Framework (DEOSEF) is proposed to guide business and semantic experts in the elicitation of EU-wide evidence for target public services, through a collaborative, context-aware, and iterative agile process involving diverse communities of practice. This paper presents DEOSEF as a foundational step for future initiatives involving a combined semantic elicitation-creation of EU-wide evidence. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Phytoplankton species are essential bioindicators for evaluating the status of freshwater ecosystems in accordance with the EU Water Framework Directive. However, manual identification of phytoplankton is time-consuming and requires taxonomic expertise. Deep learning (DL) offers promising tools for automating the identification, but challenges remain due to imaging biases, morphological diversity, and the lack of validated benchmark datasets. In this study, we trained a DL model on microphotographs of controlled laboratory strains from 20 phytoplankton species and tested its performance on independent environmental image datasets. We assessed which species are suitable for cross-dataset classification and explored whether computer vision–based image representations (DL features) reflect species similarity across datasets. Additionally, we combined shape analysis with DL features to determine whether feature-based species distances correspond to morphological similarity. The model trained on strain images achieved reliable cross-dataset classification for over half of the species. Classification performance declined with increasing feature/domain shifts between training and test images but improved when environmental images enriched the training set. Morphologically distinctive species, such as star-like forms and those with lobes or bristles, exhibited higher classification rates, whereas rectangular or roundish forms posed greater challenges. DL features consistently clustered species across datasets, and the distances in DL feature space aligned with those in simplified shape space. Our findings demonstrate that using strains as references in DL models enables effective cross-dataset classification while capturing morphological patterns. Integrating taxonomic expertise with computer vision is crucial for developing robust, interpretable phytoplankton bioindicator systems for ecological monitoring and biodiversity research. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - Cultural heritage worldwide is increasingly at risk due to climate change, armed conflict, urbanisation, illicit trafficking, and the broader forces of globalisation. These natural and human-induced threats contribute to the irreversible loss of both tangible and intangible cultural assets. In response, heritage digitisation has advanced significantly - from basic 2D documentation to sophisticated 3D technologies - underscoring the urgent need for structured, ethically grounded methodologies in data acquisition. This paper introduces the Memory Twin: an innovative framework that redefines digital heritage representation by integrating high-fidelity visuals with Paradata, Metadata, Data and intangible cultural values. Building on and extending the Holistic Historic Building Information Modelling (HHBIM) approach, the Memory Twin enriches digital heritage environments with narrative, emotional, and community-driven content, fostering inclusive access, transparency, and long-term cultural significance. Developed within the framework of the EU-funded HERITALISE project, this paper explores both the theoretical foundations and practical application of the Memory Twin through a detailed case study of Villa Portelli in Malta. By integrating 3D scanning, archival research, oral histories, and participatory engagement, the project constructs a multi-dimensional digital portrayal of the site's material, historical, and social layers. Aligned with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics) principles, the Memory Twin ensures semantic interoperability, ethical stewardship, and community empowerment. It marks a paradigm shift in heritage digitisation - from static documentation toward participatory, value-driven preservation - offering a scalable, sustainable model for safeguarding cultural heritage amid global challenges. © © 2025 Anthony Cassar et al.

AB  - To identify and track the provenance of cultural objects, experts need to follow certain rules and guidelines that help them to organize and share information. This leads to the adoption of standardized frameworks for providing a consistent way of documenting cultural objects and ensuring the interoperability, semantic enrichment and long-term preservation of information. The EU-funded ENIGMA project focuses on endorsing the safeguarding, protection, and provenance management of cultural objects. In this context, involved parties such as Legal Enforcement Agencies officers and archaeologists need to study and document the objects to identify their provenance in both space and time. This paper explores the integration of Europeana, the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CIDOC CRM), Getty Vocabularies, and Dublin Core metadata standards within a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment to develop a structured, interoperable, and semantically rich model for managing the spatiotemporal dimensions of cultural heritage data and therefore a standardized framework to support the monitoring of the provenance of potential looted cultural objects. CIDOC CRM provides an ontological framework for modeling cultural heritage entities and their complex relationships over time, facilitating the identification of the provenance of cultural objects and the associations between them. The controlled vocabularies at The Getty (the Art & Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), and Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)) are used to standardize the terminology of the descriptive attribute features. The Dublin Core and the Europeana Data Model (EDM) are used to standardise metadata and make digital resources interoperable to larger cultural property networks. In parallel, the integration of a GIS infrastructure enhances the ability to represent, analyse and visualise the spatial and temporal routes of cultural objects, allowing researchers to reconstruct historical routes, map the presence of objects and study their patterns' appearance over different periods. A key challenge in the use of Information Technologies in cultural heritage management is the integration of heterogeneous data sources [1], documenting the movement, ownership and natural or contextual changes of cultural heritage objects. This paper presents a methodological approach to encoding and visualizing these dynamics in a GIS-based environment, incorporating temporal ontologies and spatial analysis to enable detailed reconstruction of an object's historical presence and documented routes. Leveraging the principles of linked object data and semantic web technologies, the proposed model supports the creation of knowledge graphs that link objects, locations and historical events, enabling advanced spatiotemporal analysis of cultural heritage data. © © 2025 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

AB  - The digitisation of law-enforcement archives is examined with the aim of moving from static analogue records to interoperable semantic information systems. A step-by-step framework for optimal digitisation is proposed, grounded in archival best practice and enriched with artificial-intelligence and semantic-web technologies. Emphasis is placed on semantic data representation, which renders information actionable, searchable, interlinked, and automatically processed. As a proof of concept, a large language model—OpenAI ChatGPT, version o3—was applied to a corpus of narrative police reports, extracting and classifying key entities (metadata, persons, addresses, vehicles, incidents, fingerprints, and inter-entity relationships). The output was converted to Resource Description Framework triples and ingested into a triplestore, demonstrating how unstructured text can be transformed into machine-readable, interoperable data with minimal human intervention. The approach’s challenges—technical complexity, data quality assurance, information-security requirements, and staff training—are analysed alongside the opportunities it affords, such as accelerated access to records, cross-agency interoperability, and advanced analytics for investigative and strategic decision-making. Combining systematic digitisation, AI-driven data extraction, and rigorous semantic modelling ultimately delivers a fully interoperable information environment for law-enforcement agencies, enhancing efficiency, transparency, and evidentiary integrity. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The use of online services for advertising job positions has grown in the last decade, thanks to the ability of Online Job Advertisements (OJAs) to observe the labour market in near real-time, predict new occupation trends, identify relevant skills, and support policy and decision-making activities. Unsurprisingly, 2023 was declared the Year of Skills by the EU, as skill mismatch is a key challenge for European economies. In such a scenario, machine learning-based approaches have played a key role in classifying job ads and extracting skills according to well-established taxonomies. However, the effectiveness of ML depends on access to annotated job advertisement datasets, which are often limited and require time-consuming manual annotation. The lack of OJA annotated benchmarks representative of the real online OJA and skills distributions is currently limiting advances in skill intelligence. To deal with this, we propose JobGen, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic OJAs. We use real OJAs collected from an EU project and the ESCO taxonomy to represent job market distributions accurately. JobGen enhances data diversity and semantic alignment, addressing common issues in synthetic data generation. The resulting dataset, JobSet, provides a valuable resource for tasks like skill extraction and job matching and is openly available to the community. © © 2025 held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The European Union's ban on animal testing for cosmetic products and their ingredients, combined with the lack of validated animal-free methods, poses challenges in evaluating their potential repeated-dose organ toxicity. To address this, innovative strategies like Next-Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) are being explored, integrating historical animal data with new mechanistic insights from non-animal New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). This paper introduces the TOXIN knowledge graph (TOXIN KG), a tool designed to retrieve toxicological information on cosmetic ingredients, with a focus on liver-related data. TOXIN KG uses graph-structured semantic technology and integrates toxicological data through ontologies, ensuring interoperable representation. The primary data source is safety information on cosmetic ingredients from scientific opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety between 2009 and 2019. The ToxRTool automates the reliability assessment of toxicity studies, while the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation standardizes chemical identification, enabling in silico prediction of repeated-dose toxicity via the implementation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Toolbox (OECD QSAR Toolbox). The ToXic Process Ontology, enriched with relevant biological repositories, is employed to represent toxicological concepts systematically. Search filters allow the identification of cosmetic compounds potentially linked to liver toxicity. Data visualization is achieved through Ontodia, a JavaScript library. TOXIN KG, filled with information for 88 cosmetic ingredients, allowed us to identify 53 compounds affecting at least one liver toxicity parameter in a 90-day repeated-dose animal study. For one compound, we illustrate how TOXIN KG links this observation to hepatic cholestasis as an adverse outcome. In an ab initio NGRA context, follow-up in vitro studies using human-based NAMs would be necessary to understand the compound's biological activity and the molecular mechanism leading to the adverse effect. In summary, TOXIN KG emerges as a valuable tool for advancing the reusability of cosmetics safety data, providing knowledge in support of NAM-based hazard and risk assessments.

AB  - In today's data-driven environment, organizations increasingly depend on high-quality, interoperable data. This research presents a scalable, FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data integration and governance framework for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) contexts, addressing both metadata and data interoperability. The solution combines ETL pipelines, Semantic Web technologies, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Metadata interoperability is achieved via RDF schemas, SKOS vocabularies, and linked data principles; data-level integration is supported through schema mapping, format conversion, and LLM-assisted transformation. A dynamic ETL process uses semantic schema mapping and LLM-driven vocabulary suggestions to reduce manual alignment with domain ontologies. The framework is validated through a formal evaluation strategy combining real-world B2B and B2G case studies with comparative analysis against existing solutions. The system's applicability spans across critical B2B and B2G scenarios in domains such as finance, healthcare, public administration and logistics, illustrating its capacity to enable trustworthy data sharing and governance across institutional and organizational boundaries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Land use rights (LUR) management plays a vital role in ensuring transparency, legal certainty, and socio-economic development. In countries like Vietnam, where land-related procedures are governed by a comprehensive legal framework, practical challenges persist due to uncoordinated records and complex administrative processes. To support the country’s ongoing digital transformation and legal modernization efforts, this paper introduces ViLUR, a system that integrates blockchain and semantic technologies to manage LUR in compliance with Vietnam’s 2024 Land Law and related regulations. ViLUR combines blockchain technology for secure, immutable record-keeping with the Land Use Rights Ontology (LUROn), which formally models ownership structures, legal entities, and regulatory constraints. Using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, the system automates legal compliance checks for key procedures including ownership issuance, change registration, and land recovery. Deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric framework, ViLUR is experimentally evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, and reasoning time. Results show promising improvements in transaction speed, transparency, and legal consistency. The system demonstrates practical potential for modernizing land administration and aligns closely with Vietnam’s national goals for e-government and digital transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.

AB  - Today, information exchange in the AECO industry, in the different phases of the building process, typically occurs through file transfers in heterogeneous formats, with limited communication between parties. This results in potential data management issues, such as redundancy and write errors. While efforts to standardize data exchange date back to the 90 s, with formats like STEP and IFC, the challenge of interoperability remains. It’s important therefore to set up integrated management systems and interoperable cloud-based technologies. The rise of open semantic standards by W3C and other organizations in recent decades has been significant, but a cohesive connection between different ontologies is necessary for the realization of Digital Twin technology, which represents the life cycle of a building, not just the design phase. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in the building industry, this work focuses on developing a data management methodology for the use and management of existing real estate assets by public administrations, with emphasis on integrating BIM models with existing asset databases using semantic web technologies like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL. The contribution is part of a broader research activity carried out as part of the PNR Project, “BIM2DT. BIM-to-Digital Twin: information management to support decision-making in the building life cycle”. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Administrative-law provisions are still published almost exclusively in natural language, forcing every stakeholder to translate identical rules into bespoke code bases—a practice that invites inconsistency, hampers transparency, and inflates maintenance costs. Recent work on Digital Twins for Administrative Law (DTAL)[1] suggests that legislation be issued together with machine-readable ontologies and executable logic, yet guidance on how to architect such systems remains scarce. In this work we propose a layered reference architecture that separates (i) the natural-language statute, (ii) a core ontology expressed in OWL, (iii) a configuration layer for mutable policy parameters, and (iv) an executable-rule layer exposed through a RESTful and MCP façade. Grounded in design science research, we implemented a proof-of-concept twin of the Upper-Austrian tourism-levy statute and qualitatively evaluate the twin with legal, software, and public-administration experts. Early results[2] suggest that ontology-driven twins can reduce duplicate implementations, streamline updates, and enhance legal certainty, thereby strengthening the Rule of Law in automated decision-making. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Semantic Web techniques, such as ontologies, facilitate data and knowledge sharing in Information Systems due to their semantic formalization and inference qualities. Integrating knowledge-based artifacts into Decision Support Systems, such as Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DW/BI) systems, can provide new information sources, enable new analytical capabilities, and enhance decision-making. In previous work, the Balanced Scorecard Ontology (BSO) was developed to represent knowledge related to the Balanced Scorecard framework, including its concepts and relationships. The BSO was used to assess strategy formulation, implementation, and execution in a public sector organization, demonstrating its impact on strategy management. However, manual ontology population, especially related to performance indicator values, can lead to challenges in data availability, acquisition frequency, and quality. This paper proposes a semantic approach to integrating, aligning, and ensuring traceability between strategy and DW/BI systems. The Light Data Warehouse Ontology is introduced to represent the DW conceptual and logical models and semantically connect them with strategic information using the BSO. This integration enriches strategy analysis by providing strategic context to the BI environment and enabling automatic retrieval of performance indicator values. The proposed framework improves decision-making efficiency, reliability, and timeliness, providing managers with a data-driven environment aligned with organizational strategy. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Semantic technologies are gaining traction in materials science and manufacturing. Specifically, the integration of graph databases with ontologies facilitates the harmonization of typically heterogeneous materials and process data, as well as the representation of complex workflows in the field (e.g., processing experimental and simulation data or transferring and tracking data along process chains). This approach enables previously inaccessible data for scientists and engineers to be made available in a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) manner. On this basis, both science and industry, anticipate a significant boost in materials and process innovation, leading to a more resilient and sustainable production. Nevertheless, one of the main challenges in making semantic technologies usable for engineers is enabling navigation and exploration of the typically complex and flexible graph-based data structures. This work presents two approaches for data exploration in graph-databases using large language models (LLMs), namely LLM-CypherGen and SPARQL-Agent, and their application in two digital products developed within the EU research project DiMAT demonstrated across different use cases in materials science and manufacturing. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter revisits the major themes of this book and discusses implications. The ontology of war has changed. Preserving the adversarial qualities of democratic societies risks failures of ignorance, exaggeration, and misdirection. Preserving global commons remains essential for security. Design thinking offers tools to explore problems and develop creative solutions. Society itself is both an asset and a potential target for Grey Zone threats. Tools for response depend on greater awareness and investment in information, monitoring, and interagency coordination. Strategies and defensive tools must integrate traditionally separate expertise. Security education should be holistic, preparing the professionals of most countries for cross-domain employment. Military, paramilitary, police, intelligence, and public service, as inverted professions, will require early exposure to each other. Much of the necessary talent will not be in uniform, and civil-military distinctions are increasingly blurred. Breaking rules and playing dirty seems to incur low costs for major powers, and most countries must be ready for these tactics. War in the Grey Zone creates new demands on security professionals. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Marzena Żakowska and David Last.

AB  - In the process of handling public emergencies such as natural disasters, the data required by the government is diverse and cross-departmental, and a single data exchange model is far from sufficient to meet emergency response needs. This paper proposes a method for decomposing task data requirement lists based on ontology and generating task data based on a graph model. By using metadata to support the linking of task data requirement lists and data resources, it supports the construction of task data spaces and the efficient sharing of information, addressing the challenge of cross-domain data sharing in emergency situations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Large stadium events, such as sports games and concerts, have a significant impact on pedestrian flow, potentially resulting in missed business opportunities and threats to public safety. This study addresses the issue of sudden crowd surges caused by large-venue events by developing a predictive Big Data framework that integrates Wi-Fi sensing data, event schedules, and meteorological variables to forecast foot traffic. The study focuses on Sendagaya, Tokyo, an area that hosts multiple large-capacity venues. Using Random Forest regression, we evaluated our model that incorporates event and weather data and compared it with our baseline model, which uses only temporal features. Our results indicate that while temporal data alone yield stable predictions, incorporating event-specific and weather-related factors enhances the prediction accuracy of foot traffic peaks during large events. This research offers a scalable approach to urban crowd management, combining practical data collection using web scraping and multivariate modeling. These findings contribute both to Big Data modeling techniques and applications in local government, societal infrastructure planning, and marketing. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The Rapid expansion of Internet networks requires robust and scalable solutions for remote management of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE), especially for small and medium-sized Internet service providers. This paper presents the SMART-MANAGER IT platform, a multitenant, multi-user system designed to address the complexities of centralized CPE management using the TR-069 protocol. The platform integrates the open source GenieACS server with a middleware layer that enhances interoperability through the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology. Key features include real-time device monitoring, efficient data processing, advanced security mechanisms (JWT and RBAC), and customisable dashboards tailored to different user roles. In a production environment, the system demonstrated remarkable scalability and performance, successfully managing 5,000 devices with minimal latency (average 25 ms) and maintaining stability under high load. The proposed architecture significantly reduces operational costs for small ISPs while ensuring seamless CPE management. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for large-scale IoT ecosystems. Future work will focus on integrating the TR-369 protocol to support next-generation device management and further enhance system capabilities. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2025.

AB  - Smart cities represent a paradigm shift in urban development, leveraging advanced technologies to enhance efficiency and sustainability. However, implementing City Information Modeling (CIM) faces significant challenges across technical, data-related, organisational, security, and privacy domains, hindering interoperability and effectiveness. This study proposes a Unified City Information Modeling (UCIM) framework as a comprehensive solution to standardise and harmonise data streams and operational processes within smart city ecosystems. Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Semantic Interoperability Framework (SIF), UCIM bridges gaps between city management systems, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration across sectors such as transportation, healthcare, energy, and public services. The framework will enhance data exchange and system integration, support informed decision-making and resource optimisation, and pave the way for resilient, efficient, and sustainable urban development. This research underscores UCIM's potential to transform urban management practices and recommends further exploration through practical case studies to validate its application in diverse urban settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - Electrifying transportation is a growing initiative among governments and therefore companies seeking alternatives to carbon-intensive vehicles. While the automotive industry's demand for electric vehicles increases, sectors like aerospace are also exploring electric applications. However, relying on batteries as the primary power source presents challenges such as high costs, limited availability of raw materials, and safety concerns. Additionally, inconsistent battery usage leads to varying rates of battery degradation, posing further difficulties. This study aims to understand battery degradation in electric aircraft subjected to different battery charging parameters using multi-domain modeling. The long-term goal is to facilitate the commercialization of electric aircraft by making them more economically viable while considering real-world constraints. An open-source multi-domain model built in the MATLAB-Simscape environment provides a robust platform to simulate different flight profiles and track battery degradation in terms of battery capacity. To analyze battery behavior under various conditions, we examined different flight routes characterized by distinct load profiles with varying charging parameters. The analysis focuses on a battery pack composed of Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt cells with a capacity of 260~Ah at 418~V; resulting in a nominal pack capacity of 109~kWh. We evaluated the effects of battery degradation across three flight routes in the southeastern United States under two charging rates: 1.5C and 2C. Results show that charging at 1.5C degrades the battery significantly less than charging at 2C. Additionally, starting flights with an initial state of charge of 80% instead of 100% further reduced battery degradation across all flight routes. Variations in flight route length were found to have a minimum effect. By incorporating battery degradation into smarter route planning, the study offers pathways to improve the sustainability and economic viability of electric aviation. This suggests that careful selection of battery charging parameters can mitigate some of the current limitations of electric aircraft. © 2024 Lockheed Martin Corporation. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The ever-increasing amount of data available through Open Data portals follows the momentum and proliferation of Open Data initiatives and, apart from the numerous benefits offered, poses a reality which brings forth several challenges. Metadata quality and management are key aspects in this regard; in their absence affecting the interoperability, findability, and consequently, open data consumption. The present study aims to analyse several semantic aspects of 3 major international data portals and their metadata schemas mapped to the main DCAT schema classes in order to assess the current status regarding metadata provision and aiming towards prospective standardisation and improved semantic interoperability of the datasets available. The analysis revealed several persisting challenges, including the lack of standardised information (e.g., controlled vocabularies) as accepted values of the identified mandatory metadata fields in use, or, in the case of existing standardisation schemas, a misalignment and lack of consensus among the different portals. The study also pinpoints future research lines centred around the elicitation of guidelines and practices to standardise not only descriptive but also domain-specific metadata provision across the portals, facilitating the process towards the identification of minimum sets of metadata descriptions applicable to various contexts, and reaching one step closer to the envisioned interoperable ODPs paradigm. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The globalization of world economy stimulates large number of people to search abroad for better employment opportunities. This is the reason to consider the exchange of occupational health assessment summary (OHAS) content from cross-border view point. It is a problem of larger social-significance than the cross-border exchange for International Patient Summary (IPS). While the IPS dataset is well studied in the framework of an international standard, the OHAS remains rather insufficiently explored in the existing literature. This paper proposes a novelty systematic approach to provide a practicable solution to this problem by ensuring semantic interoperability in the exchange of OHAS. It starts by presenting a description of the use case for cross-border exchange. Next, the OHAS dataset is defined on the basis of exploring common data requirements the national legislation of EU countries. The final step of this approach is the design of an EN 13606 archetype of OHAS satisfying all the requirements for semantic interoperability in the exchange of clinical data. Further on, the static, non-volatile and reusable information model of OHAS is used to create EN 13606 instances that are valid with respect to the Reference model and the datatypes of this standard. Finally, this paper demonstrates the software implementation of basic activities in the OHAS use case in a fully functional web application, where the EN 13606 instances are managed by means of a native XML database. © 2024, Sofia University St Kliment Ohridski Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics.

AB  - The main objective of this article is to provide an overview of the current state of development regarding certification and standardization efforts for Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in military aviation. The incorporation of AI capabilities in the military holds the potential for significant strategic advantages in information and decision supremacy. However, AI also brings novel risks and safety considerations that existing certification processes are inadequate to address. Consequently, the need arises for the establishment of an entirely new certification framework, encompassing requirements and standardized processes tailored to the unique demands of AI safe-ty. During the development of such framework, the 7 High Level Requirements of the EU AI High Level Experts Group are taken as reference to develop the successive horizontal (cross-domain) and vertical (domain-specific) standards that would produce legal, robust and ethical AI. To facilitate the creation of a new AI certification framework in military aviation, a review has been done over traditional civil and military certification processes and the current AI certification progress under development, to present an overview of the key elements and processes involved. References from various levels (regulatory, industry, research) have been considered to provide an introduction to the prospective military AI certification framework. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This article addresses the complex challenges that public organizations face in designing, implementing, and evaluating their strategies, where public interest and regulatory compliance often intertwine with strategic objectives. This research investigates the application of ontologies in the field of public sector strategy management to enhance the capacity of organizations to make informed data-driven decisions, efficiently allocate resources, and effectively navigate the intricate landscape of the public sector. The LNEC - National Laboratory for Civil Engineering's strategy is used as an exploratory case study. Semantic web technologies are used to perform strategy analysis, including validating the strategy formulation and supporting the strategy execution by assessing performance indicators, verifying the design of cause-and-effect relationships between strategic objectives, and monitoring and empirically validating these relationships. The increased interoperability of these technologies enables information sharing across systems and organizations. Following the strategy analysis, recommendations are provided, leading to a more robust and data-driven strategic management approach, enabling accurate, traceable, and continuous monitoring of an organization's strategy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, along with limitations and future work. This research offers a blueprint for public sector organizations seeking to optimize their strategies, foster transparency, and deliver more effective services to the public they serve. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The proliferation of digital building models in recent years has led to a corresponding rise in specialised, non-interoperable models. These models impede sustainable developments by forming data silos that hinder cross-application data exchange and knowledge discovery processes. Although Semantic Web solutions hold promise in addressing these silos, current approaches primarily focus on developing novel ontologies, yielding similar outcomes. But it is unclear how these methodologies could support broader knowledge discovery processes and application requirements. This paper addresses these research challenges by introducing a dynamic knowledge graph as implemented within The World Avatar for interoperable building models. We demonstrate its value through two distinct applications in urban energy management and laboratory automation. The dynamic knowledge graph revolves around a comprehensive structured knowledge model constructed from ontologies and agents. Ontologies semantically annotate data and represent domain knowledge and their relationships with standardised definitions. When augmented with an agent architecture, the resulting knowledge model can align stakeholder perspectives and accommodate the dynamic and scalable nature of urban data. Moreover, the dynamic knowledge graph fosters innovative human-machine interactions through visualisation interfaces to augment knowledge discovery processes in the built environment for greater efficiencies and innovation. As the knowledge model expands, users gain access to a broader spectrum of private and public data sources and technologies, while reducing integration barriers. This is especially pertinent for smaller and less influential entities like municipal and local governments with limited resources, who can realise substantial benefits at reduced costs. © 2024

AB  - The paper focuses on the design and implementation of the Hellenic Legislation Portal aiming at becoming a central hub for legal resources produced in Greece. Though the project focuses on current law production the goal of the portal is to gradually incorporate all legislation issued from the foundation of the Modern Greek state and the publishing of the Government Gazette (1833 onwards). The project had to ensure its compatibility and interoperability with N-lex and EUR-Lex environments and align standards and terminology with its European counterparts as well as to accommodate local needs. The present study provides both the technical as well as the administrative challenges of the project. The case study presents the initial phase of the project and incorporates data deriving from the early implementation stages. The challenges emerging from the over-regulated and fragmented Hellenic legislation are discussed in relation to the technical issues arising from these particular elements. Furthermore, the adaptation of the ontological model (ELI) and the increasing need for securing semantic alignment and thematic specifications are presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Purpose: Building information modelling (BIM) has transformed the traditional practices of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. BIM creates a collaborative digital representation of built environment data. Competitive advantage can be achieved with collaborative project delivery and rich information modelling. Despite the abundant benefits, BIM’s adoption in the AEC is susceptible to confrontation. A substantial impediment to BIM adoption often cited is data interoperability. Other facets of interoperability got limited attention. Other academic areas, including information systems, discuss the interoperability construct ahead of data interoperability. These interoperability factors have yet to be surveyed in the AEC industry. This study aims to investigate the effect of interoperability factors on BIM adoption and develop a comprehensive BIM adoption model. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical foundations of the proposed model are based on the European interoperability framework (EIF) and technology, organization, environment framework (TOE). Quantitative data collection from construction firms is gathered. The model has been thoroughly examined and validated using partial least squares structural equation modelling in SmartPLS software. Findings: The study’s findings indicate that relative advantage, top management support, government support, organizational readiness and regulation support are determinants of BIM adoption. Financial constraints, complexity, lack of technical interoperability, semantic interoperability, organizational interoperability and uncertainty are barriers to BIM adoption. However, compatibility, competitive pressure and legal interoperability do not affect BIM adoption. Practical implications: Finally, this study provides recommendations containing the essential technological, organizational, environmental and interoperability factors that AEC stakeholders can address to enhance BIM adoption. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies to combine TOE and EIF in a single research model. This research provides empirical evidence for using the proposed model as a guide to promoting BIM adoption. As a result, the highlighted determinants can assist organizations in developing and executing successful policies that support BIM adoption in the AEC industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The rapid depletion of fossil fuel reserves coupled with the ever-increasing demand for electrical power has prompted the search for new energy sources. Electric vehicles (EVs) are one potential answer because of the technology that allows for more efficient transportation while simultaneously reducing fossil fuel usage and emissions of greenhouse chemicals. Depending on the power system's capability, structure, and architecture, several studies have shown that the distribution network may be negatively affected by the widespread interconnection of electric vehicles. Consequently, it is important to determine the effects of this additional load on the network so that measures can be taken to prevent threats to the system's stability, dependability, and security, especially because the Indian federal and state governments have introduced incentives to increase sales of this type of vehicle. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - As cyber-physical systems become increasingly interconnected and complex, ensuring their cyber security becomes paramount. Composite systems, comprised of multiple interconnected components, present unique challenges for cyber security certification due to their dynamic nature and diverse elements and used technologies. This paper proposes the development of an ontology specifically tailored for the cyber security certification of composite systems. Ontologies provide a structured framework for representing knowledge, allowing for semantic interoperability and in future automated reasoning. This ontology also aims to capture the intricate relationships between components, vulnerabilities, threats, and security controls within composite systems. Multi-layered approach employed, encompassing both technical and organizational aspects of cyber security, comprehensively address certification requirements. Also, we discuss the practical implications of proposed ontology in streamlining certification procedures, enhancing risk management, and promoting trustworthiness in composite systems. Through this work, we strive to contribute to the advancement of cyber security certification practices, EU regulation in the context of evolving composite systems (EU Common Criteria Framework). © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The European Union’s initiative on European data spaces aims to support innovation and economic growth by facilitating secure, interoperable data sharing across key sectors such as health, energy, and mobility. Within European data spaces, high priority is given to adherence to FAIR data principles. Thus, data and services should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Ontologies as semantic models are fundamental in achieving semantic interoperability, as they provide a common framework for data and service access, discovery, understanding and reuse. However, the inherent complexity of data space initiatives, coupled with their underlying domains diversity are key challenge facing optimal FAIRness. This motivates the need for an agile methodology that aligns with data space principles, integrates existing domain standards, consolidates the use of metadata for ontology’s FAIRness, and engages various involved actors (domain experts, data service providers, ontology engineers) towards the development of common data space ontology. In the frame of the OMEGA-X project, aiming to build an energy data space, this paper presents AIME, an ontology development methodology integrating the reuse of both standards and reference ontologies to enable the development of modular ontologies for data spaces. It leverages agile principles to strengthen communication between various stakeholders through different steps: reference standards and ontologies selection, selection of use cases, design and selection of interaction models capturing data exchanges, ontology modules creation, automation and continuous integration features to support the entire original ontology engineering phase and reuse by data space users. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Real estate asset operations typically represent around 80% of investment and management costs, with space management and system monitoring being crucial for user well-being.The AECO industry is moving towards a data-driven model, combining various type of data from various sources. In addition, the inclusion of sensor systems in buildings is leading to a shift towards a distributed semantic approach, requiring a deeper understanding of reality and the ability to link different ontologies from various fields. So, the need to address challenges such as data interoperability, integration of different semantic domains, and improvement of information exchange processes has recognized semantic web technologies as a powerful tool for enhancing the value of BIM models by facilitating data integration and enabling the application of complex queries across multiple data sources. The proposed paper aims to analyze the state of art about IoT and semantic web technologies, and their possible integration in a BIM environment to aid decision-making in building maintenance. It will provide a first ongoing approach for the digitalization of the assets managed by the University of Florence's Building Area. The study shows the two different workflows set up to connect BIM models with sensor data. The first one involved the use of DTH22 environmental sensors integrated through Node-Red to the open source platform Snap4City for data management; the second one involved the installation of LORAWAN sensors within a building and the use of a property platform, Niagara Tridium, for data manipulation and sampling to be convolved within a BMS platform. The work is part of a larger EU Next Generation research project titled, "BIM2DT. BIM-to-Digital Twin: information management to support decision-making in the building life cycle". © 2024 The author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Modern forestry increasingly relies on the management of large datasets, such as forest inventories and land cover maps. Governments are typically in charge of publishing these datasets, but they typically employ disparate data formats (sometimes proprietary ones) and published datasets are commonly disconnected from other sources, including previous versions of such datasets. As a result, the usage of forestry data is very challenging, especially if we need to combine multiple datasets. Methods and results: Semantic Web technologies, standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have emerged in the last decades as a solution to publish heterogeneous data in an interoperable way. They enable the publication of self-describing data that can easily interlink with other sources. The concepts and relationships between them are described using ontologies, and the data can be published as Linked Data on the Web, which can be downloaded or queried online. National and international agencies promote the publication of governmental data as Linked Open Data, and research fields such as biosciences or cultural heritage make an extensive use of Semantic Web technologies. In this study, we present the result of the European Cross-Forest project, addressing the integration and publication of national forest inventories and land cover maps from Spain and Portugal using Semantic Web technologies. We used a bottom-up methodology to design the ontologies, with the goal of being generalizable to other countries and forestry datasets. First, we created an ontology for each dataset to describe the concepts (plots, trees, positions, measures, and so on) and relationships between the data in detail. We converted the source data into Linked Open Data by using the ontology to annotate the data such as species taxonomies. As a result, all the datasets are integrated into one place this is the Cross-Forest dataset and are available for querying and analysis through a SPARQL endpoint. These data have been used in real-world use cases such as (1) providing a graphical representation of all the data, (2) combining it with spatial planning data to reveal the forestry resources under the management of Spanish municipalities, and (3) facilitating data selection and ingestion to predict the evolution of forest inventories and simulate how different actions and conditions impact this evolution. Discussion: The work started in the Cross-Forest project continues in current lines of research, including the addition of the temporal dimension to the data, aligning the ontologies and data with additional well-known vocabularies and datasets, and incorporating additional forestry resources. © © 2024 Giménez-García, Vega-Gorgojo, Ordóñez, Crespo-Lera and Bravo.

AB  - ShowVoc is a web-based, multilingual, platform for publication and consumption of datasets complying with Semantic Web standards. Born in the context of the ISA2 European programme for the development of digital solutions for interoperable cross-border and cross-sector public services, ShowVoc aims at providing a one-stop shop for maximizing the diffusion of semantic and lexical resources as Linked Open Data. To this end, ShowVoc combines traditional data provisioning following LOD policies with global activities (e.g. global search, navigation of dataset relationships/alignments, translation API benefiting from multilingual datasets and linksets). A rich dataset browsing interface provides dedicated support for diverse data models: OWL ontologies, SKOS/SKOS-XL thesauri, OntoLex-Lemon lexicons and generic RDF datasets and linkage possibilities (EDOAL, XKOS). A metadata registry completes the offer combining different metadata vocabularies into an advanced catalog that can be inspected through a convenient user interface and LOD best practices. Finally, ShowVoc is an ideal companion to VocBench, a popular collaborative editing environment for Semantic Web resources, complementing it for realizing an entire workflow embracing all stages of a dataset life, from realization and maintenance, to release and publication. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This article illustrates how to enhance data interoperability among Public Administrations (PPAA) by leveraging the publication of e-services based on Semantic Web (SW) technologies such as ontologies, controlled vocabularies, and data schemas, which, through standard languages like OWL [6], RDF[12], and SPARQL [5], ensure harmonization, integrability, and unique semantics for representing administrative data. Furthermore, the potential benefits of implementing semantic e-services through Ontology-based Data Management (OBDM), a data governance methodology that enables data services through ontologies, decoupling their implementation from the physical data sources of PPAA, are discussed. Additionally, the advantages for PPAA of data exchange through semantic e-services utilizing concepts published in the Schema platform, developed by the National Data Catalog project funded through PNRR funds, will be highlighted in the presented use case. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Web3 needs complex semantic frameworks to update, validate, and regulate data across decentralized networks as it grows. The whole semantic system of this study includes SV, SC, DOC, ISV, and SG. The Semantic Validation technique performs parametric validation, scoring, and threshold comparison to safeguard data integrity, whereas the Semantic Agreement algorithm combines meanings by adding agreement values. Decentralized ontologies are improved using Distributed Ontology Construction to accommodate new meaning linkages. connected Semantic Verification detects semantic meaning compatibility across linked networks. Lastly, meaning Governance enables individuals to decide on recommended meaning modifications without centralization. Comparative analysis examines the framework. Tables and illustrations indicate its dominance over key aspects. The recommended strategy generally outperforms Web3 evolution methods in security, scale, interoperability, user privacy, and government effectiveness. Visualizing the process with pie charts, layered analysis, and temporal trends shows its efficacy. This semantic framework's consistency, correctness, and flexibility are key responses to Web3's changes. The framework's continual refinement methods can shape Web3 Internet semantics as open networks change. This semantic framework helps establish a decentralized and connected Internet as bitcoin and Web3 technologies progress. It also allows Web3-aligned semantic development. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Identifying promising and frontier technologies is a fundamental step for technological management, especially for planning R&D policies by governments and companies. Among the intellectual property (IP) assets, the patents have a strategic role because they contain from 70 to 90% of information about technologies. One of the most prominent phases in managing patents is their classification according to a proposed taxonomy, a particularly expensive and time-consuming phase, above all due to the increase in the number of filed patents, the complexity of the contents and the difficulty in classify them in the right category. Users that search for a potentially useful patent, often deal with “monster class”, multidisciplinary categories containing a significant number of poorly characterized and classified patents. Monster categories are thus ineffective, not discriminating, and difficult to explore. A typical example of “monster class” is often present in the healthcare related patents, due to its multidisciplinary and particularly innovative nature. The paper proposes an approach for: i) improving taxonomy-based classification by using Natural Language Processing and clustering techniques; ii) improving keywords-based classifications by using a complex network analysis on the most frequent words. The approach was experimented on Knowledge-Share platform (an Italian patent platform) with a particular attention on patent related to healthcare 4.0 with the aim of identifying the technology trends in this cross-domain context, where artificial intelligence is identified to be having an impact, such as in robotic assisted surgery, personalized medicine, drug discovery, imaging & diagnostic, diseases monitoring, assisted living, automated clinical decision support, elderly care, and so on. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and satellites are becoming increasingly popular in business, government, and military applications. Both have unique use cases and value, but they have several overlapping use cases and features. Most notably they are both used for observation, such as the case of climate monitoring or surveying and mapping. Satellites also have uses in communication and navigation by broadcasting signals and enabling technology such as global positioning systems (GPS). UAVs have also been deployed by the militaries across the world for both reconnaissance and offensive capabilities. Each are electro-mechanical systems with a several important components that need to be reliable and high performance. Maximizing the return in value for these assets might mean improving their performance, reliability, or longevity. One emerging technology that has the promise to do this is the digital twin (DT). DTs utilize a combination of multi-domain modeling and extensive data collection for real-time model updates. This real time updating can be utilized for advanced simulation, improved control, and advanced condition monitoring. DTs are an ideal platform for applying to UAVs and satellites to maximize their capabilities and values. As will be demonstrated in this work, DTs have been demonstrated to provide value in improving control performance, orientation and position tracking, condition monitoring, and fault detection in UAVs and satellites. A case study and preliminary work on a CubeSat attitude adjustment device DT has been presented and examined to display benefits of the concept. © 2024 SPIE.

AB  - Background: The U.S. Federal Government has supported the generation of extensive amounts of nanomaterials and related nano Environmental Health and Safety (nanoEHS) data, there is a need to make these data available to stakeholders. With recent efforts, a need for improved interoperability, translation, and sustainability of Federal nanoEHS data in the United States has been realized. The NaKnowBase (NKB) is a relational database containing experimental results generated by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) regarding the actions of engineered nanomaterials on environmental and biological systems. Through the interaction of the National Nanotechnology Initiative’s Nanotechnology Environmental Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group, and the Database and Informatics Interest Group (DIIG), a U.S. Federal nanoEHS Consortium has been formed. Methods: The primary goal of this consortium is to establish a “common language” for nanoEHS data that aligns with FAIR data standards. A second goal is to overcome nomenclature issues inherent to nanomaterials data, ultimately allowing data sharing and interoperability across the diverse U.S. Federal nanoEHS data compendium, but also in keeping a level of consistency that will allow interoperability with U.S. and European partners. The most recent version of the EPA NaKnowBase (NKB) has been implemented for semantic integration. Computational code has been developed to use each NKB record as input, modify and filter table data, and subsequently output each modified record to a Research Description Framework (RDF). To improve the accuracy and efficiency of this process the EPA has created the OntoSearcher tool. This tool partially automates the ontology mapping process, thereby reducing onerous manual curation. Conclusions: Here we describe the efforts of the US EPA in promoting FAIR data standards for Federal nanoEHS data through semantic integration, as well as in the development of NAMs (computational tools) to facilitate these improvements for nanoEHS data at the Federal partner level. ©: © 2024 Mortensen HM et al.

AB  - This study focuses on the implementation of ontology-based e-government services for government departments to promote economic growth and sustainability and is called Nigeria Ontology-Based e-Government Services (NigOeGov). The dataset was obtained from literature, organisational documents, and the individual ministry website. Five steps were involved in its implementation, while a hierarchical breakdown structure was used for the ontology categorisation. Protégé OWL 5.5.0 and SPARQL were used for ontology development and query generation, respectively. The results based on the ontology’s elements were: total axiom count, class count, object property count, data property count, and individual count; 127, 9, 8, 4, and 29, respectively. The result further shows various classes of federal ministries, their subclasses as departments, agencies, and units, and the instant of each ministry and the interaction among them. In conclusion, this semantic representation gives detailed information about each ministry from an interface, providing easy access to information for the citizens. © © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The transition towards a circular economy (CE) will require data sharing across different platforms and data spaces of parties operating in a variety of supply chains. From a circular economy compliance monitoring perspective, beyond the access to mandatory data that governments will receive, authorities may benefit from accessing additional business data from the source on a voluntary basis, which is challenging. While platforms and data spaces solve a great deal of complexity and interoperability within their realm, platform, and data space interoperability is still challenging. In the logistics domain, efforts have been made to overcome these issues of data sharing across logistics platforms with a Semantic data sharing architecture developed by the CEF FEDeRATED Action, at the heart of which is a semantic model aligning other semantic models for logistics. In this paper, we take the Semantic data sharing architecture as a point of departure and examine the opportunities and limitations that it has for CE monitoring, and how it relates to other developments in the EU and beyond. Many of these developments acknowledge the need for data access across heterogeneous systems and – processes of actors; others add security and trust to data sharing that goes all the way to the level to cover legal obligations. The goal of this paper is to gain further insights into how data sharing across multiple platforms and data spaces enables circular economy monitoring, where government organizations would need to address the issue of how they would interface with, and access data that resides in multiple platforms and data spaces. We found that the various models can be aligned on some architecture principles that promote interoperability across dimensions (e.g. federation, keeping data at the source), yet they still differ on other dimensions (e.g. data model and semantics, as well as how they address issues of identification, authentication and authorization). We suggest further efforts towards developing meta-level agreements and standardization for data space interoperability and we propose further research directions on that topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The semantic web and ontology are extensions of the World Wide Web that aim to make data more interconnected and machine-readable. This systematic review examined researched publications published between 2018 and 2023 and indexed in Google Scholar and Science Direct. 23 records were chosen and classified into six groups: information and retrieval, knowledge archiving, interoperability, enhancing public and employee services, barriers to ontology application, and use of ontologies to apply the regulations. This study explored the semantic web and ontology used to enhance e-government services. It found that improving ontology for searched and information retrieval processes could help computers retrieve accurate results, improve interoperability and integration, and provide a knowledge base for terms used in building databases and applications. However, more research is needed to effectively integrate ontology into existing systems and extend these approaches to real-world contexts. Future research should focus on presenting an applied model of e-government technology and conducting continuous evaluations. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Background: Geopolitical and economic crises force a growing number of people to leave their countries and search better employment opportunities abroad. Meanwhile, the highly competitive labor market provides opportunities for employees to change workplaces and job positions. Health assessment data collected during the occupational history is an essential resource for developing efficient occupational disease prevention strategies as well as for ensuring the physical and psychological well-being of newly appointed workers. The diversity in data representation is source for interoperability problems that are insufficiently explored in the existing literature. Objectives: This research aims to design a worker's occupational health assessment summary (OHAS) dataset that satisfies the requirements of an international standard for semantic interoperability in the use case for exchanging extracts of such data. The focus is on the need for a common OHAS standard at EU level allowing seamless exchange of OHAS at both cross-border and at the worker's country of origin level. Results: This paper proposes a novelty systematic approach ensuring semantic interoperability in the exchange of OHAS. Two use cases are explored in terms of UML sequence diagram. The OHAS dataset reflects common data requirements established in the national legislation of EU countries. Finally, an EN 13606 archetype of OHAS is designed by satisfying the requirements for semantic interoperability in the exchange of clinical data. Semantic interoperability of OHAS is demonstrated with realistic use case data. Conclusions: The designed static, non-volatile and reusable information model of OHAS developed in this paper allows to create EN 13606 archetype instances that are valid with respect to the Reference model and the datatypes of this standard. Thus, basic activities in the OHAS use case can be implemented in software, for example, by means of a native XML database as well as integrated into existing information systems. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The legislative landscape, characterized by overwhelming amounts of legal data which, on many occasions, is only accessible by legal experts, the fragmented nature of information and the ever-increasing number of disparate systems, have given more impetus to the interoperability realm of legal data. The semantic interoperability of Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) requires rich and well-defined metadata, as well as the establishment of standards, in order to be able to connect and link these scattered legal data resources. This is usually achieved through the transformation of legal information into structured format and through the utilization of legal ontologies whose main purpose is to connect the legal basis of two or more countries by allowing for reusability and the ability to adequately represent legal information, which is understood and retrieved across borders. Within the context of this study, the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and Akoma Ntoso (AKN) ontologies are mapped in order to make legal data compatible and reusable in as many contexts as possible and to support the Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) concept. The mapping of these two widely used legal ontologies was evaluated by domain experts and strongly validated by tools. The usefulness of the produced mapping is proven through its real-life context application, although one thing to consider regarding possible future perspectives, could be the inclusion and mapping of more legal ontologies to expand the application domain and improve the semantic interoperability of legal information. These mappings could be either achieved using similar methodological approaches or applications of automated and AI-based ontology mapping techniques. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Cities are increasingly becoming augmented with sensors through public, private, and academic sector initiatives. Most of the time, these sensors are deployed with a primary purpose (objective) in mind (e.g., deploy sensors to understand noise pollution) by a sensor owner (i.e., the organization that invests in sensing hardware, e.g., a city council). Over the past few years, communities undertaking smart city development projects have understood the importance of making the sensor data available to a wider community - beyond their primary usage. Different business models have been proposed to achieve this, including creating data marketplaces. The vision is to encourage new startups and small and medium-scale businesses to create novel products and services using sensor data to generate additional economic value. Currently, data are sold as pre-defined independent datasets (e.g., noise level and parking status data may be sold separately). This approach creates several challenges, such as (i) difficulties in pricing, which leads to higher prices (per dataset); (ii) higher network communication and bandwidth requirements; and (iii) information overload for data consumers (i.e., those who purchase data). We investigate the benefit of semantic representation and its reasoning capabilities toward creating a business model that offers data on demand within smart city Internet of Things data marketplaces. The objective is to help data consumers (i.e., small and medium enterprises) acquire the most relevant data they need. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by integrating it into a real-world IoT data marketplace (developed by the synchronicity-iot.eu project). We discuss design decisions and their consequences (i.e., tradeoffs) on the choice and selection of datasets. Subsequently, we present a series of data modeling principles and recommendations for implementing IoT data marketplaces. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Calls for new metrics, technical standards and governance mechanisms to guide the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in institutions and public administration are now commonplace. Yet, most research and policy efforts aimed at understanding the implications of adopting AI tend to prioritize only a handful of ideas; they do not fully connect all the different perspectives and topics that are potentially relevant. In this position paper, we contend that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the 'relational problem' in socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been settled - including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems, and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across fields - consisting of three horizontal domains for grouping relevant concepts and related methods: Operational, Epistemic, and Normative. We first situate this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two premier academic venues, AIES and FAccT, before illustrating how developing suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing relevant concepts in each of these domains. Finally, we outline outstanding questions for developing this relational approach to institutional AI research and adoption. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Technical and semantic interoperability are broadly used components of interoperability technology in healthcare. Technical Interoperability provides interoperability interfaces to enable data exchange within different healthcare systems, despite any underlying heterogeneity. Semantic interoperability make different healthcare systems understand and interpret the meaning of the data that is exchanged, by using and mapping standardized terminologies, coding systems, and data models to describe the concept and structure of data. We propose a solution using Semantic and Structural Mapping techniques within CAREPATH; a research project designed to develop ICT solutions for the care management of elderly multimorbid patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Our technical interoperability solution supplies a standard-based data exchange protocol to enable information exchange between local care systems and CAREPATH components. Our semantic interoperability solution supplies programmable interfaces, in order to semantically mediate different clinical data representation formats and incorporating data format and terminology mapping features. The solution offers a more reliable, flexible and resource efficient method across EHRs. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The EU's proposed AI Act sets out a risk-based regulatory framework to govern the potential harms emanating from use of AI systems. Within the AI Act's hierarchy of risks, the AI systems that are likely to incur "high-risk"to health, safety, and fundamental rights are subject to the majority of the Act's provisions. To include uses of AI where fundamental rights are at stake, Annex III of the Act provides a list of applications wherein the conditions that shape high-risk AI are described. For high-risk AI systems, the AI Act places obligations on providers and users regarding use of AI systems and keeping appropriate documentation through the use of harmonised standards. In this paper, we analyse the clauses defining the criteria for high-risk AI in Annex III to simplify identification of potential high-risk uses of AI by making explicit the "core concepts"whose combination makes them high-risk. We use these core concepts to develop an open vocabulary for AI risks (VAIR) to represent and assist with AI risk assessments in a form that supports automation and integration. VAIR is intended to assist with identification and documentation of risks by providing a common vocabulary that facilitates knowledge sharing and interoperability between actors in the AI value chain. Given that the AI Act relies on harmonised standards for much of its compliance and enforcement regarding high-risk AI systems, we explore the implications of current international standardisation activities undertaken by ISO and emphasise the necessity of better risk and impact knowledge bases such as VAIR that can be integrated with audits and investigations to simplify the AI Act's application. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Demand Response (DR) is becoming a cornerstone element in the current energy sector, particularly for the EU energy markets. For this reason, considerable effort has been spent on standardising demand response data models. As a result, there is an ever-growing number of demand response proposals based on these standards. However, these proposals are usually centralised, and those that rely on cloud solutions use the cloud as a centralised data store assuming that the data is already homogenised when stored, i.e. all the data has the same format and model. Nevertheless, in practise, DR proposals rely on several components that provide data in heterogeneous formats and models. Furthermore, the different DR standards define models for different data formats that hinder data exchange between different DR systems. In this article, a generic tool called CIM is presented, which allows existing DR systems to distribute their components in the cloud, providing a solid security and privacy framework for data exchange. In addition, the CIM implements a semantic interoperability layer that is capable of translating data into a normalised form when exchanged so that it can be transparently consumed by DR components. Experiments advocate the CIM as a solution for DR systems to decentralise their architectures and exchange heterogeneous data even with other DR systems that follow different DR standards. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Beyond 5G (B5G) in mobile network technologies is the latest communication technology currently under development. B5G is expected to achieve superior capabilities in ultra-high network transmission speed, low latency, low energy consumption, and high coverage, comparing to current 5G network performance. Although B5G is still in the development and implementation stage, there are many patents and non-patent literature depicting B5G innovative technologies and applications. The landscapes of B5G technologies are great references for governments and industries to understand the advances in mobile communication for R&D strategies. Thus, this research focuses on developing a formal tech-mining workflow integrating semantic-based patent and non-patent literature analysis for ontology building, patent technological topic clustering, and graph convolutional network (GCN) modeling for depicting key technology interactions among clusters of sub-domain topics. This research emphasizes the study of B5G patent landscape and key technology interaction roadmap in comprehensive steps as a valuable reference for B5G mobile network R&D, as well as for conducting tech-mining of other technology domains of interests. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to an exponential increase in data generation, especially from wearable IoT devices. While this data influx offers unparalleled insights and connectivity, it also brings significant privacy and security challenges. Existing regulatory frameworks like the United States (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8228, the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to address these challenges but often operate in isolation, making their compliance in the vast IoT ecosystem inconsistent. This paper presents the IoT-Reg ontology, a holistic semantic framework that amalgamates these regulations, offering a stratified approach based on the IoT data lifecycle stages and providing a comprehensive yet granular approach to IoT data handling practices. The IoT-Reg ontology aims to transform the IoT domain into a realm where regulatory controls are seamlessly integrated system components by emphasizing risk management, compliance, and the pivotal role of manufacturers' privacy policies, ensuring consistent adherence, enhancing user trust, and promoting a privacy-centric IoT environment. We include the results of validating this framework against risk mitigation for Wearable IoT devices. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the harmonization and representation of semantic data models used in future energy management systems. In order to support interoperability and maintain data coherence, it is crucial to interpret exchanged information consistently and accurately. Common semantic data models play a vital role in acquiring semantic knowledge and addressing the challenge of semantic interoperability. These models enable effective interoperation between heterogeneous systems in terms of both data and services. This paper focuses on our experience in the Platoon H2020 EU project and its seven pilots. Within this context, we provide background information on data models, present an overview of existing semantic data models, describe the proposed methodology for this task, and provide a detailed account of each step in the methodology. The modeling process was conducted in two phases: the first phase involved scenario descriptions, while the second phase utilized datasets from various pilots. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Proliferation of data sources associated to Internet of Things (IoT) deployment as well as those bound to Open Data Portals (e.g. European Data Portal, Municipalities Open Data Portals, etc.) and Social Media platforms is creating an abundance of information that is called to bring benefits for both the private and public sectors, through the development of added-value services, increasing administrations' transparency and availability or fostering efficiency of public services. However, pieces of information without a context are significantly less valuable. Raw data lacks semantics and it is highly heterogeneous from one data-source to another. This poses a challenge to make it useful. To turn all this data into valuable information it is necessary to enable its combination so that meaningful context can be created. Moreover, it is fundamental to define the mechanisms enabling the adoption and orchestration of advanced (typically AI-enabled) data processing techniques to be applied over the harmonized datasets and data-streams. This paper presents the Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that provides the necessary harmonization and enrichment to datasets and data-streams coming from heterogeneous sources. The value of the enriched data lies on the one hand in the transfer of the data into a semantically grounded knowledge graph and, on the other hand, in the creation of new data through linking, aggregating and reasoning on the data. In both cases, the benefit of employing linked-data modelling and semantics comes from the extension of the metadata that is associated to every piece of information. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of the DET implementation that we have carried out is also presented in the paper. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The rapid growth of data and increasing complexity in various domains necessitate advanced data management solutions that address data quality, security, and interoperability challenges. This paper presents a modified algorithm for dynamic data transformation based on blockchain technology for Master Data Management Systems (MDM), incorporating Ethereum, IPFS and semantic data. Based on the proposed algorithm, an architectural approach is also described that allows developing semantic data management systems. The algorithm assumes data validation, enrichment, and deduplication processes, while also ensuring consistency and trust among multiple participants through the decentralized nature of the blockchain. The semantic data management aspect of the system is achieved using Apache Jena and local ontology, which facilitate semantic interoperability and efficient data processing. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of applying blockchain technology to semantic MDM systems and demonstrates an approach to using the system in Semantic Web, as well as in areas such as finance, healthcare, public administration, and logistics. We evaluated the algorithm using a customer information dataset from an e-commerce platform. The results confirmed the potential of blockchain technology in data management and showed improvements in data accuracy, consistency, completeness, but with some loss in storage efficiency due to the use of blockchain. This paper contributes to developing and evaluating a novel algorithm and architecture, combining blockchain technology, MDM principles, and semantic data management for improving data quality, security, and performance in decentralized systems. However, further research and assessment may be required for the full implementation and evaluation of the system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Internet of things interconnects increasing numbers of artefacts and individuals, allowing the setup of ambient intelligence systems in multi-domains (e.g., hospitals). Designing a suitable architectural framework is required to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of such systems. Consolidating public services about citizens’ safety and authorisation decisions when a resource is accessed in an open-dynamic environment are the main challenges that can be highlighted. Therefore, the semantic heterogeneity between the local policies of the different domains is a crucial lock for implementing this process. Our approach goes beyond the semantic web languages’ weaknesses by combining the XACML-based security policy model with a semantic rules language developed during the European SembySem Project. Built on top of RDF(S), the proposed model aims to abstract the security implementation, reconcile semantic differences across multi-domain, and maintain the local security policy. Moreover, this model addresses the semantic heterogeneity of sensors’ data during knowledge-sharing. © © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The provision of public services (PS) is at the heart of public authority operations as it directly affects citizens’ lives and the prosperity of society. Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in online catalogues to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Union has developed the Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) as a PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and promote semantic interoperability. The use of CPSV-AP is increasing within the European Union leading to a number of relevant PS descriptions that are also potentially beneficial for the implementation of the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) regulation. However, the use of heterogeneous, some times not very popular technologies (e.g. RDF) to provide access to such data hinders their further uniform exploitation. Towards this problem definition, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can provide a uniform, easily-consumable way of serving such data hiding any heterogeneity of the underlying technologies. The aim of this paper is to design and implement an API to serve data based on CPSV-AP facilitating the implementation of the SDG and the further exploitation of data at added value services and tools e.g. chatbots. The paper describes the requirements, use cases, design choices and implementation details of the API. We anticipate that the proposed API will help towards the further adoption of CPSV-AP by facilitating and homogenizing the consumption of relevant data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Open government data refers to data that is made available by government entities to be freely reused by anyone and for any purpose. The potential benefits of open government data are numerous and include increasing transparency and accountability, enhancing citizens' quality of life, and boosting innovation. However, realizing these benefits is not always straightforward, as the usage of this raw data often faces challenges related to its format, structure, and heterogeneity which hinder its processability and integration. In response to these challenges, we propose an approach to maximize the usage of open government data and achieve its potential benefits. This approach leverages knowledge graphs to extract value from open government data and drive the construction of a knowledge graph from structured, semi-structured, and non-structured formats. It involves the extraction, transformation, semantic enrichment, and integration of heterogeneous open government data sources into an integrated and semantically enhanced knowledge graph. Learning mechanisms and ontologies are used to efficiently construct the knowledge graph. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach using real-world public procurement data and show that it can detect potential fraud such as favoritism © 2023, International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Conforming to multiple and sometimes conflicting guidelines, standards, and legislations regarding development, deployment, and governance of AI is a serious challenge for organisations. While the AI standards and regulations are both in early stages of development, it is prudent to avoid a highly-fragmented landscape and market confusion by finding out the gaps and resolving the potential conflicts. This paper provides an initial comparison of ISO/IEC 42001 AI management system standard with the EU trustworthy AI assessment list (ALTAI) and the proposed AI Act using an upper-level ontology for semantic interoperability between trustworthy AI documents with a focus on activities. The comparison is provided as an RDF resource graph to enable further enhancement and reuse in an extensible and interoperable manner. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The European Platform on Rare Disease Registration (EU RD Platform) aims to address the fragmentation of European rare disease (RD) patient data, scattered among hundreds of independent and non-coordinating registries, by establishing standards for integration and interoperability. The first practical output of this effort was a set of 16 Common Data Elements (CDEs) that should be implemented by all RD registries. Interoperability, however, requires decisions beyond data elements - including data models, formats, and semantics. Within the European Joint Programme on Rare Diseases (EJP RD), we aim to further the goals of the EU RD Platform by generating reusable RD semantic model templates that follow the FAIR Data Principles. Results: Through a team-based iterative approach, we created semantically grounded models to represent each of the CDEs, using the SemanticScience Integrated Ontology as the core framework for representing the entities and their relationships. Within that framework, we mapped the concepts represented in the CDEs, and their possible values, into domain ontologies such as the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology, Human Phenotype Ontology and National Cancer Institute Thesaurus. Finally, we created an exemplar, reusable ETL pipeline that we will be deploying over these non-coordinating data repositories to assist them in creating model-compliant FAIR data without requiring site-specific coding nor expertise in Linked Data or FAIR. Conclusions: Within the EJP RD project, we determined that creating reusable, expert-designed templates reduced or eliminated the requirement for our participating biomedical domain experts and rare disease data hosts to understand OWL semantics. This enabled them to publish highly expressive FAIR data using tools and approaches that were already familiar to them. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper demonstrates a proof of concept for cross-border information exchange guided by the single digital gateway regulation (SDGR) and once-only principle (OOP). The research systematically investigates the challenges and limitations of existing solutions for semantic interoperability. Furthermore, the concept of canonical evidence is introduced as a tool for the cross-border exchange of structured data automatically with less ambiguity and in compliance with the legal requirements of the selected public services. A design science research approach in an agile set-up is applied in the artefact (canonical evidences) development process. The requirements are elicited based on eight case studies set up in the context of the EU initiative, Digital Europe for all (De4a). The data models developed in this study are in compliance with the requirements and provisions of a selected set of EU member states. The outcome of the study includes eleven evidence types that could be reusable in executing procedures of respective e-Government services. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Forest industries deserve special attention due to relations between environmental impact and social and economic development. The increase of forest fires caused by the untenable exploitation has motivated the application of concepts such as Industry/Forestry 4.0 and Internet of Forest Things (IoFT) towards improving the performance of current supply chains and assuming an environmental responsibility. This research focuses on the application of IoFT for the prediction of wildfires behavior and proposes a semantic platform for heterogeneous IoFT data aggregation that grants interoperability through semantic technologies. The dataset considered climatic- and vegetation-related data gathered by Brazilian government sensors and satellite information on fires, and Machine Learning predicted the areas affected after a fire event. Both platform and predictions were validated and Random Forest predicted the area with 89% accuracy, showing better performance than Deep Neural Network, with 79%. © 2022

AB  - Open data portals contain valuable information for citizens and business. However, searching for information can prove to be tiresome even in portals tackling domains similar information. A typical case is the information residing in the European Commission’s portals supported by Member States aiming to facilitate service provision activities for EU citizens and businesses. The current work followed the FAIR principles (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse of digital assets) as well as the GO-FAIR principles and tried to transform raw data into fair data. The innovative part of this work is the mapping of information residing in various governmental portals (Points of Single Contacts) by transforming information appearing in them in RDF format (i.e., as Linked data), in order to make them easily accessible, exchangeable, interoperable and publishable as linked open data. Mapping was performed using the semantic model of a single portal, i.e., the enriched Greek e-GIF ontology and by retrieving and analyzing raw, i.e., non-FAIR data, by defining the semantic model and by making data linkable. The Data mapping process proved to require a significant manual effort and revealed that data value remains unexplored due to poor data representation. It also highlighted the need for appropriately designing and implementing horizontal actions addressing an important number of recipients in an interoperable way. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The provision of public services (PS) is at the heart of public authority operations as it directly affects citizens’ lives and the prosperity of society. Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in an online catalogue to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Commission has developed Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP), as a standard European PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and semantic interoperability. However, CPSV-AP is not sufficient to model complex PS with different versions based on rules and citizens’ circumstances (e.g., getting a passport for a child or for an emergency). As a result, citizens cannot obtain personalized information on PS. The aim of this paper is to enhance CPSV-AP in order to support the modeling of complex PS. We illustrate the use of the proposed model in a real-life case study. Specifically, we use the proposed model to develop a knowledge graph and a chatbot that provides personalized information to citizens of the city of Bjelovar (Croatia) regarding the life-event “having a baby”. We believe our research is of interest to researchers on PS data models and public authorities interested in providing personalized PS information to their citizens using chatbots. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: Open government data (OGD) has emerged as a radical paradigm shift and endeavor among government administrations across the world mainly due to its promises of transparency, accountability, public-private collaboration, civic participation, social innovation and data-driven value creation. Complexity, cross-cutting nature, diversity of data sets, interoperability and quality issues usually hamper unlocking the full potential value of data. To tackle these challenges, this paper aims to provide a novel solution using a top-down approach. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a systematic ontology-based approach combined with a novel architecture and its corresponding processes enabling organizations to carry out all the steps in the OGD value chain. In addition, an OGD Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) are developed to showcase the proposed solution. Findings: The efficiency and the applicability of the solution are evaluated by a real-life use case on energy consumption of the buildings of the city of Tehran, Iran. Finally, a comparison was made with existing solutions, and the results show the proposed approach is able to address the existing gaps in the literature. Originality/value: The results imply that modeling and designing the data model, as well as exploiting an ontology-based approach are critical pillars to create rich, relevant and well-described OGD data sets. Moreover, clarity on processes, roles and responsibilities are the key factors influencing the quality of the published data services. Thus, to the best of the knowledge, this is the first study that exploits and considers an ontology-based approach in a top-down manner to create OGD data sets. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This article develops an ontological description of land use and applies it to incorporate geospatial information describing land coverage into a knowledge-graph-based Universal Digital Twin. Sources of data relating to land use in the UK have been surveyed. The Crop Map of England (CROME) is produced annually by the UK Government and was identified as a valuable source of open data. Formal ontologies to represent land use and the geospatial data arising from such surveys have been developed. The ontologies have been deployed using a high-performance graph database. A customized vocabulary was developed to extend the geospatial capabilities of the graph database to support the CROME data. The integration of the CROME data into the Universal Digital Twin is demonstrated in two use cases that show the potential of the Universal Digital Twin to share data across sectors. The first use case combines data about land use with a geospatial analysis of scenarios for energy provision. The second illustrates how the Universal Digital Twin could use the land use data to support the cross-domain analysis of flood risk. Opportunities for the extension and enrichment of the ontologies, and further development of the Universal Digital Twin are discussed. © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Digitalisation promotes online education, internationalisation and student mobility. Based on the Bologna process and the European higher education area, learning mobility has been successful under Erasmus and other similar initiatives. However, a key issue for students and universities is that a significant amount of time is spent on the manual labour involved in the process of applying to degree programs overseas. It is therefore essential for higher education institutions to better exploit the potential of technology and Web 2.0 to enable a secure exchange of evidence during application for degree programs and academic courses in foreign Higher Education Institutions, as well as applying for study grants and obtaining recognition for academic and other types of studies. Harmonisation of the student data is a key initial step for enabling such exchange. In this study, an approach to a secured exchange of education evidence is instrumented under the H2020 project Digital Europe for All (DE4A). Existing semantic standards for Web 2.0 applications, core vocabularies for public service data and semantic assets from existing best practices such as W3C, ISA2 core vocabularies, and Europass data model are used to curate data models that allow the exchange of a higher education diploma, secondary education diploma and information of special needs (disability, large family), which is required by students when requesting study grants (waive of tuition fees). The semantic interoperability agreements are established cross-border through these data models called canonical evidences. The canonical evidences are tested with the national data services of three countries, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. The final data models are implemented in XML Schema format that could be used by any educational organisation intending to use trusted public service databases within Europe to automatically retrieve information on students’ degrees. The validity of the canonical evidences is tested on two pilot occasions within the DE4A project. The outcome of this study summarises the procedural requirements for evidences when applying for a higher degree program and seeking grants. Furthermore, it resulted in verified canonical evidence data models that fulfil the procedural requirements for applying for studying abroad. © 2021 Academic Conferences Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The emergence of e-Government as a concept and practice has been a significant development over the last decade. Government Institutions have developed various applications providing public or inter-governmental services. These E-Government applications, some are legacy applications, were built independently using different platforms. Consequently, this heterogeneity creates problems such as lack of data integration and system interoperability. This integration/interoperability problem makes it difficult to perform semantic linking between databases to create a government knowledge base which is critical for knowledge discovery and innovation. Ontology has been regarded as a promising technology to solve this integration/interoperability problem as it provides semantic interoperability and promotes knowledge discovery and innovation. To support the development and operation of cross domain government ontology services for semantic interoperability in e-government systems, it is necessary to define an ecosystem model. The aim of research is to design an ontology development ecosystem model for Indonesian E-Government System using Ecosystem Pie Model. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Although more assessment and certification schemes aimed at buildings appear on the market, professionals always face the same challenges: information scarcity and data flow interruptions. It therefore becomes crucial to rigorously assess the information workflows associated with built assets in order to help deliver the subsequent assessment services and certification schemes. The Smart Readiness Indicator is a new assessment scheme directed at harmonizing the smartness levels of buildings and intelligent installations at a European level. While the European Union defines the Smart Readiness Indicator scope and assessment methodology towards new regulations with the member states, the availability of data should strategically rely on existing sources such as the Building Information Model in order to automate and simplify the efforts of assessors. This paper explores the potential of Building Information Model data, more specifically relying on the Industry Foundation Classes schema, to support assessors with more automatic extraction of relevant information on the building and its equipment. The adopted methodology looks at the semantic alignment between the two domains. An initial alignment of concepts from several versions of the Industry Foundation Classes is proposed. This alignment was implemented using several rules, which were tested on the architectural and mechanical models of the same building. The study shows the convenience of employing such a methodology, the usefulness of data from existing building models, but also their limitations in correctly identifying relevant concepts. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Buildings are the largest energy consumers in Europe and are responsible for approximately 40% of EU energy consumption and 36% of the greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. Two-thirds of the building consumption is for residential buildings. To achieve energy efficiency, buildings are being integrated with IoT devices through the use of smart IoT services. For instance, a smart space heating service reduces energy consumption by dynamically heating apartments based on indoor and outdoor temperatures. The W3C recommends the use of the Web of Things (WoT) standard to enable IoT interoperability on the Web. However, in the context of a smart building, the ability to search and discover building metadata and IoT devices available in the WoT ecosystems remains a challenge due to the limitation of the current WoT Discovery, which only includes a directory containing only IoT devices metadata without including building metadata. Integrating the IoT device's metadata with building metadata in the same directory can provide better discovery capabilities to the IoT services providers. In this paper, we integrate building metadata into the W3C WoT Discovery through the construction of a Building Description JSON-LD file. This Building Description is integrated into the W3C WoT Discovery and based on the domOS Common Ontology (dCO) to achieve semantic interoperability in smart residential buildings for the WoT IoT ecosystem within the Horizon 2020 domOS project. This integration results in a Thing and Building Description Directory. dCO integrates the SAREF core ontology with the Thing Description ontology, devices, and building metadata. We have implemented and validated the WoT discovery on top of a WoT Thing and Building Description Directory. The WoT Discovery implementation is also made available for the WoT community. © 2022 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Interoperability in e-Government is important to improve public services by enabling systems to exchange, integrate, and use information in a meaningful manner. However, e-government systems along with heterogeneous databases have created difficulties in interoperability. These heterogeneous databases lead to data redundancy, data inconsistency, and difficulty to integrate data and process data among agencies. The representation of heterogeneous systems through common standards and vocabularies is considered a valuable solution for interoperability. In this paper, an ontology-based framework for Bhutan's e-government is proposed to support semantic interoperability. To evaluate the framework, the domain ontology for Bhutan's Administrative Division, namely BTNAD is developed and discussed. BTNAD Ontology has been implemented and verified using Protégé, and its practical usage has been validated by checking against the defined competency questions and the corresponding SP ARQL query implementation. The presented study can clearly demonstrate the Single Source of Truth (SSOT), hence enabling the data reusability and collaboration, and interoperability within and across the agencies. Finally, the research discusses some recommendations from the proposed framework and interoperability challenges. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - According to the 2021 energy efficiency report of the European Union (EU), 75% of the existing buildings in the EU have been assessed as energy-inefficient. Internet of Things (IoT) services are developed to increase energy efficiency in buildings. The W3C recommends the use of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard to enable IoT interoperability on the Web. However, the ability to discover IoT devices available in the WoT remains a challenge due to the lack of ontologies integrating WoT Thing Descriptions in smart buildings. We present in this paper the domOS Common Ontology (dCO) to achieve the W3C WoT discovery in smart residential buildings in 5 demonstration sites of the H2020 EU domOS project. This ontology integrates the WoT Thing Description with IoT concepts, i.e. IoT devices and building topology, in order to leverage the W3C WoT Discovery. We made the WoT Discovery implementation available for the community. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The RESTORE project (smaRt accESs TO digital heRitage and mEmory) started in June 2020 with a duration of 2 years. The project consortium, coordinated by the Istituto Opera del Vocabolario Italiano of the Italian CNR (National Research Council of Italy), includes national Cultural Heritage institutes, such as the State Archives and the Museum of Palazzo Pretorio in Prato and the Archival and Bibliographic Superintendency of Tuscany, and the SPACE SpA software company. The project - co-financed by the Regione Toscana - has its main purpose in the recovery, integration and accessibility of data and digital objects collected by partner, in order to build a knowledge base made of information regarding the history of the city and of its civic institutions, the development of its economic and entrepreneurial system, the role of women in the development of a welfare state and network. Starting a local history approach, it is nonetheless possible to broaden the focus from the local dimension to reconstruct a significant part of the history of European and Mediterranean cities of the 14th century, including commercial and economical aspects. This paper presents a focused overview on the mapping and modeling of archival and museum digital resources encoded with different standards, such as XML-EAD, XML-EAC, XML-TEI and ICCD-OA, and covered in the CIDOC-Conceptual Reference Model, the ontology that was chosen as "common language"for semantic data integration. The long term sustainability for the project's results will be fostered by the collaboration with key players in the EU RIs environment, such as DARIAHERIC (ESFRI Landmark for the Humanities and Social Sciences) and E-RIHS (ESFRI project for the Heritage Science), as well as other actors within the EOSC Framework. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The Centre for the Study of Manuscript Cultures (CSMC) at the Universität Hamburg hosts a steadily growing number of autonomously developed databases. These databases often run in heterogeneous hardware and software environments and use different, project-specific data models. These conditions lead to a high degree of autonomy but to an increasing heterogeneity. The heterogeneity then leads to the problem that these databases cannot be easily merged into a federated database system (FDBS). In general, a FDBS integrates multiple autonomous database systems into a single FDBS. The challenge is now to merge multiple heterogeneous systems into one FDBS to provide successful federated searches. Here, the term successful means that the results of a search query are correctly and completely answered by all integrated domain-specific database systems. In addition to delivering correct and complete results from these queries, semantically and syntactically correct mappings of various database schemes must be ensured. We argue that at the faculty of the Humanities, a cross-domain use of autonomously developed databases offers added value in terms of data analysis and evaluation. Hence, the challenge that exists is to develop a suitable federated database infrastructure that supports the development of autonomous information systems, while heterogeneity does not increase. To meet this challenge, in IT projects in the defense sector and in the public administration of the federal government, the V-model is a mandatory procedural standard to develop IT systems systematically. When developing a cross-domain information system, special attention should be paid to the development of variants, i.e. the project-specific information systems, so that the extension of the federated infrastructure at the faculty is guaranteed and can be maintained in the long term. In the area of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) variant modeling is a very current topic and no standard exists. However, there are some approaches that can be used, such as the method Variant Modeling with SysML (VAMOS). VAMOS is characterized by its ease of use to model variants and can be combined very well with other methods. In this paper we present a model-based approach to develop a federated database infrastructure for supporting the usability of a cross-domain information system. For the development of a federated database infrastructure we present how the V-model can be combined with the VAMOS method using the tool Cameo Systems Modeler for modeling and simulating in general, the broker-based SysML Toolbox for simulating database interactions, and the database management system Heurist for creating a cross-domain information system. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Ontologies provide an opportunity to tackle the interoperability challenge in digital manufacturing. Although ontologies have been used in numerous industrial projects, the problem of semantic interoperability in the industry is still unresolved. One reason for the lack of success of ontologies in the industry is that most industrial ontologies have been developed based on local needs without taking wider applications into account or attempting to learn from earlier ontology initiatives or reuse the existing ontologies. In this position paper, we argue that for widespread adoption and implementation of ontologies, more systematic and coordinated efforts are needed with the participation of industry, academia, and government at an international level. We also hypothesise that a coordinated and systematic ontology development effort will incrementally lead to the creation of an ecosystem of interoperable software applications that support consistent data access and reasoning across the product life cycle. We discuss why efforts such as Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) can promote a methodological ontology development process by introducing modular, and reusable ontologies. We draw examples from two domain areas, namely supply chain management and production planning and scheduling, to demonstrate how industrial notions can be analysed ontologically according to IOF procedures and methods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Information for Action! is a Joint Action (JA-InfAct) on Health Information promoted by the EU Member States and funded by the European Commission within the Third EU Health Programme (2014–2020) to create and develop solid sustainable infrastructure on EU health information. The main objective of this the JA-InfAct is to build an EU health information system infrastructure and strengthen its core elements by a) establishing a sustainable research infrastructure to support population health and health system performance assessment, b) enhancing the European health information and knowledge bases, as well as health information research capacities to reduce health information inequalities, and c) supporting health information interoperability and innovative health information tools and data sources. Methods: Following a federated analysis approach, JA-InfAct developed an ad hoc federated infrastructure based on distributing a well-defined process-mining analysis methodology to be deployed at each participating partners’ systems to reproduce the analysis and pool the aggregated results from the analyses. To overcome the legal interoperability issues on international data sharing, data linkage and management, partners (EU regions) participating in the case studies worked coordinately to query their real-world healthcare data sources complying with a common data model, executed the process-mining analysis pipeline on their premises, and shared the results enabling international comparison and the identification of best practices on stroke care. Results: The ad hoc federated infrastructure was designed and built upon open source technologies, providing partners with the capacity to exploit their data and generate dashboards exploring the stroke care pathways. These dashboards can be shared among the participating partners or to a coordination hub without legal issues, enabling the comparative evaluation of the caregiving activities for acute stroke across regions. Nonetheless, the approach is not free of a number of challenges that have been solved, and new challenges that should be addressed in the eventual case of scaling up. For that eventual case, 12 recommendations considering the different layers of interoperability have been provided. Conclusion: The proposed approach, when successfully deployed as a federated analysis infrastructure, such as the one developed within the JA-InfAct, can concisely tackle all levels of the interoperability requirements from organisational to technical interoperability, supported by the close collaboration of the partners participating in the study. Any proposal for extension, should require further thinking on how to deal with new challenges on interoperability. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents an approach how to create FAIR data for prehistoric mining archaeology, based on the CIDOC CRM ontology and semantic web standards. The interdisciplinary Research Centre HiMAT (History of mining activities in the Tyrol and adjacent areas, University of Innsbruck) investigates mining history from prehistoric to modern times with an interdisciplinary approach. One of the projects carried out at the research centre is the multinational DACH project “Prehistoric copper production in the eastern and central Alps”. For a specific geographical region of the project, the data transformation to open and re-usable data is investigated in a separate Open Research Data pilot project. The methodological approach will use the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Every archaeological investigation in Austria has to be documented according to the requirements of the Austrian Federal Monuments Office. This documentation is deposited in the CERN-based EU supported research data repository ZENODO. For each deposited file, metadata are created through the application of the conceptual metadata schema CIDOC CRM, an ISO standard for Cultural Heritage Information, which was adopted by ARIADNE, the European Union Research Infrastructure for archaeological resources. Concepts specific to mining archaeology research are organized with the DARIAH Back Bone Thesaurus, a model for sustainable interoperable thesauri maintenance, developed in the European Union Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Metadata are created through the extraction of information from the documentation and the transformation to a knowledge graph using semantic web standards. To facilitate usage, graph data are exported to hierarchical and tabular formats representing sites and objects with their geographic locations, temporal and typological assignments and links to the research activities and documents. Metadata are deposited together with the documentation into the repository. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Context: Organizations often use different applications to support the Scrum process, including project management tools, source repository and quality assessment tools. These applications store useful data for decision-making. However, data items often remain spread in different applications, each of which adopt different data and behavioral models, posing a barrier for integrated data usage. As a consequence, data-driven decisions in agile development are uncommon, missing valuable opportunities for informed decision making. Objective: Considering the need to address semantic issues to properly integrate applications that support the agile development process, we aim to provide a common and comprehensive conceptualization about Scrum in the software development context and apply this conceptualization to support application integration. Method: We have developed the Scrum Reference Ontology (SRO) and used it to semantically integrate Azure DevOps and Clockify. Results: SRO served as a reference model to build software artifacts in a semantic integration architecture that enables applications to automatically share, exchange and combine data and services. The integrated solution was used in the software development unit of a Brazilian government agency. Results demonstrate that the integrated solution contributed to improving estimates, provided data that helped allocate teams, manage team productivity and project performance, and enabled to identify and fix problems in the Scrum process execution. Conclusions: SRO can serve as an interlingua for application integration in the context of Scrum-process support. By capturing the conceptualization underlying Scrum, the reference ontology can address semantic conflicts and thereby support the development of integrated data-driven solutions for decision making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a paradigm shift from the traditional Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry practices to digital construction delivery processes. BIM provides the capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity, and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas, such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability. These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European Interoperability framework and develop BIM Interoperability Model with factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and legal interoperability in intra –organizational AEC units, inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes, and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project delivery well informed, more structured, and effective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The fact that both the ISO 19152:2012 Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) and the OGC 15–111r1 Land and Infrastructure Conceptual Model Standard (LandInfra) exist within the domain of Land Administration, calls for a mediating platform, which could support an alignment of the standards. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate, how semantic tools have been used to establish such platform. Semantic tools include thesauri. The Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus (CaLAThe) was issued in 2011 and based on the then draft version of the ISO LADM standard. CaLAThe was further developed to include also terms of the OGC LandInfra standard of 2016. The recent version (December 2019) integrates code list names and values, reflecting both the relevant Survey and Land division parts of LandInfra and, as proof of concept, some of the code lists mentioned in the Annex J Code lists of LADM. CaLAThe thus constitutes a shared universe of discourse, a frame for joint management of the code lists of the mentioned standards. Taking a problem-based approach to the design of artefacts like standards, the mentioned alignment of standards is part of a problem hierarchy. In this hierarchy, development of information standards provides a means for improving public administration, more specifically its aspects of e-government and interoperability. These aspects have spurred interest in semantic tools; for example, standardization organizations have recently publicized their terminological resources in terms of the ISO/TC211 Geolexica glossary and the OGC Definitions Server. The definitions of CaLAThe and the mentioned code lists are by December 2019 included into the OGC Definitions Server. Besides servicing the Land Administration communities, CaLAThe illustrates the use of thesauri as a cross-domain means for supporting the alignment of standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the increasing developments in the Internet of Things (IoT), smart-city applications have been attracting widespread interest in many governments, organizations, and companies. The FED4IoT project is a research and innovation project that aims to develop a smart-city application, named 'VirIoT,' which realizes the semantic interoperability of IoT data among numerous IoT applications from different grounds. To realize the semantic interoperability of IoT data, data management on cloud platforms, such as FIWARE, is considered necessary. Therefore, the development of a root data domain gateway (RDG), which analyzes IoT data, converts its data format, and posts the data to the cloud service, is required. In this project, Kanazawa Institute of Technology has chosen wildlife monitoring as one of the use cases of the project, and its system using IoT has been designed and developed. Furthermore, its data model has been created for the development of the RDG. Finally, the RDG has been developed as a first step in the semantic interoperability of IoT data. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - An Intelligence Platform for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and explosives (CBRNe) Events and Asymmetric Threats has been developed as a pilot prototype to meet the needs of organizations, specialist, experts, professionals from the intelligence, law-enforcement, military, chemical, biological, radiological/nuclear and health domains. The main goal was to provide a tool able to collect open source information in an asymmetric threats environment, with a focus on CBRNe events and terrorism, and with a pilot focus on COVID-19 related information, and to generate outcomes that can help analysis of trends, threats and intelligence sources, with application across security, academia and health fields. The developed IT solution is a flexible and innovative instrument offering support to CBRNe risk and Asymmetric threat knowledge management by monitoring a wide range of information sources, using normalized terminologies, based on tuned ontology and able to enhance interaction and communication between different international entities (semantic interoperability). The experimentation aimed to provide a lite tool that can be adopted at different levels, including where less skills and economic resources are available (local units of complex organizations, public administrations in developing Countries, SMEs, ONGs, media). The activities have been carried out by the Observatory on Security and CBRNe Defence OSDIFE - Italy, in cooperation with the University of Rome “Tor Vergata” - Department of Electronic Engineering - Italy, the State University of the Republic of San Marino - Center for Security Studies, the Flinders University - Australia and Expert AI - Italy. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Nowadays, the free movement of people and goods within the European Union is one of the topical issues. Each member state and border practitioner exploits its own set of assets in their goal of border surveillance and control. States have invested significantly in these assets and infrastructures necessary to manage and control the transit in the border areas. As new capabilities and assets become available and as current Command and Control (C2) systems become older, border control practitioners are faced with the increasing challenge of how to integrate new assets, command and control all of them in a coordinated and coherent way without having to invest in a completely new C2 systems built from the ground up. Therefore, and bearing in mind that the systems already developed up to date are very old and are not framed in a global standard data model, it has been identified, on one side the need to define a platform that allows to interact with multiple UxVs (land, sea and air), and on the other, unify all data models so that it can globalize and generate a much more concise analysis of what happens in places of conflict. © 2021. by the authors.

AB  - Morocco has launched several e-government programs to develop efficient public e-services which meet the needs of users. However, while digitizing public services processes for Moroccan administrations, the designers of information systems record the entered data in databases, without being too interested in the meaning of the entries made by citizens nor on the benefit of exchanged information between public administrations. This causes inconsistency and lack of interoperability between public administration systems. Moreover, the systems require information collection and shared knowledge based on a common vocabulary of public services in Morocco. For this purpose, this paper presents an ontology model based on the 5w1h Method for defining the public services domain. This PSOM ontology is based on the referential defined by the Moroccan Ministry of Administration Reform and Public service. Indeed, we have collected the different concepts related to this field and all possible relationships between them in order to ensure interoperability between all government entities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - In process-centric public enterprises, the business process (BP) is at the center of value-delivery of public services to the citizens. Governing public enterprise BPs requires the ability to control and guide BP activities according to applied laws. Ensuring compliance of processes with legal regulations becomes a critical government requirement. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework for regulatory-compliance management that provides an integrated view of the law architecture model, public enterprise model, and BP lifecycle to enable the design of compliance solutions that cover the full business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design time, runtime, and offline monitoring and analysis. The proposed framework is based on an integrated semantic model representing the business process model and administrative laws concepts which provide a shared conceptualization of the BP activities and the related legal rules. This work seeks to lay down the requirements of an integrated architecture for semantic regulatory-compliance management in the context of the BP management lifecycle. The focus of this paper is the design-time compliance approach. Our proposed design-time compliance solution was validated using a running example from the Universal Health Insurance program of Egypt. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Complex data domains increase the difficulty of structuring, sharing, discovering and governing information. For the geospatial domain common models such as INSPIRE have been established in the European Union. The United Nations initiative on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) draws together national and regional capacities. Interoperability is the main principle behind these initiatives. Nonetheless there is a lack of published research to date on mapping agency geospatial linked data leveraging the UN-GGIM taxonomy of information management data themes. Thus, we have identified use cases and defined a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)[3] taxonomy expressing the UN-GGIM data themes for national spatial infrastructure. This has been applied in a metadata generation and reporting tool for Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) which underpinned improved governance and reporting infrastructure in OSi. This demonstrated the contribution of Semantic Web technology to spatial data governance as well as its importance for data publishing. This paper presents a documented open license SKOS taxonomy for the UN-GGIM data themes that follows Linked Data best practices. It provides a set of three use cases, an overview of UN-GGIM theme definitions and an example application of the taxonomy for deployment in OSi for DCAT metadata generation and data publishing pipeline reporting. © © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The European Union Agency for Railways is an European authority, tasked with the provision of a legal and technical framework to support harmonized and safe cross-border railway operations throughout the EU. So far, the agency relied on traditional application-centric approaches to support the data exchange among multiple actors interacting within the railway domain. This lead however, to isolated digital environments that consequently added barriers to digital interoperability while increasing the cost of maintenance and innovation. In this work, we show how Semantic Web technologies are leveraged to create a semantic layer for data integration across the base registries maintained by the agency. We validate the usefulness of this approach by supporting route compatibility checks, a highly demanded use case in this domain, which was not available over the agency’s registries before. Our contributions include (i) an official ontology for the railway infrastructure and authorized vehicle types, including 28 reference datasets; (ii) a reusable Knowledge Graph describing the European railway infrastructure; (iii) a cost-efficient system architecture that enables high-flexibility for use case development; and (iv) an open source and RDF native Web application to support route compatibility checks. This work demonstrates how data-centric system design, powered by Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles, provides a framework to achieve data interoperability and unlock new and innovative use cases and applications. Based on the results obtained during this work, ERA officially decided to make Semantic Web and Linked Data-based approaches, the default setting for any future development of the data, registers and specifications under the agency’s remit for data exchange mandated by the EU legal framework. The next steps, which are already underway, include further developing and bringing these solutions to a production-ready state. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Electricity markets are complex and dynamic environments with very particular characteristics. Ambitious goals, including those set by the European Union, foster the increased use of distributed generation, essentially based on renewable energy sources. This requires major changes in electricity markets and energy systems, namely through the adoption of the smart grid paradigm. The use of simulation tools and the study of different market mechanisms and the relationships between their stakeholders are essential. One of the main challenges in this area is developing decision support tools to address the problem as a whole. This work contributes to increasing interoperability between heterogeneous systems, namely agent-based, directed to the study of electricity markets, the operation of smart grid, and energy management. To this end, this work proposes the use of ontologies to ease the interaction between entities of different natures and the use of semantic web technologies to develop more intelligent and flexible tools. A multiagent systems society, composed of several heterogeneous multiagent systems, which interact using the proposed ontologies, is presented as a proof-of-concept. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Government archives comprise a series of documents or important information resources produced or used by government departments to meet the needs of economic and social governance, fulfill government functions, and perform official activities. They have inestimable value in economic development, social operations, and strategy. However, due to the lack of effective application of knowledge management technology, government information resources are locked in archive records, making it difficult to achieve knowledge organization and interoperability. Based on the theories and methods of the semantic web and semantic ontology construction, we summarize the relevant domain knowledge of government archives and construct the Chinese Government Archive Ontology (GAO) with the collection of government archives as the data. The ontology model implements the semantic interoperability between government archives and performs knowledge representation and reasoning on their content. We define the classes and properties of GAO, describe its creation process in detail, and demonstrate its applicability in practice through SPARQL query and event logical representation based on the 5W1H framework. GAO is capable of realizing linked data and discovering the knowledge hidden behind the policies of various agencies and departments, which can serve scientific decision-making and the economic society, regulate institutional powers, and further promote the research and practice of archival science in the digital age. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The timely and efficient cooperation across sectors and borders during maritime crises is paramount for the safety of human lives. Maritime monitoring authorities are now realizing the grave importance of cross-sector and cross-border information sharing. However, this cooperation is compromised by the diversity of existing systems and the vast volumes of heterogeneous data generated and exchanged during maritime operations. In order to address these challenges, the EU has been driving several initiatives, including several EU-funded projects, for facilitating information exchange across sectors and borders. A key outcome from these efforts is the Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), which constitutes a collaborative initiative for promoting automated information sharing between maritime monitoring authorities. However, the adoption of CISE is substantially limited by its existing serialization as an XML Schema only, which facilitates information sharing and exchange to some extent, but fails to deliver the fundamental additional benefits provided by ontologies, like the richer semantics, enhanced semantic interoperability and semantic reasoning capabilities. Thus, this paper presents EUCISE-OWL, an ontology representation of the CISE data model that capitalizes on the benefits provided by ontologies and aims to encourage the adoption of CISE. EUCISE-OWL is an outcome from close collaboration in an EU-funded project with domain experts with extensive experience in deploying CISE in practice. The paper also presents a representative example for handling information exchange during a maritime crisis as well as performance results for specific querying tasks that can demonstrate and evaluate the use of the proposed ontology in practice. © 2021 – IOS Press.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to develop a Web-based application system called Infomediary of Taiwanese Indigenous Peoples (ITIP) that can help individuals comprehend the society and culture of indigenous people. The ITIP is based on the use of Semantic Web technologies to integrate a number of data sources, particularly including the bibliographic records of a museum. Moreover, an ontology model was developed to help users search cultural collections by topic concepts. Design/methodology/approach: Two issues were identified that needed to be addressed: the integration of heterogeneous data sources and semantic-based information retrieval. Two corresponding methods were proposed: SPARQL federated queries were designed for data integration across the Web and ontology-driven queries were designed to semantically search by knowledge inference. Furthermore, to help users perform searches easily, three searching interfaces, namely, ethnicity, region and topic, were developed to take full advantage of the content available on the Web. Findings: Most open government data provides structured but non-resource description framework data, Semantic Web consumers, therefore, require additional data conversion before the data can be used. On the other hand, although the library, archive and museum (LAM) community has produced some emerging linked data, very few data sets are released to the general public as open data. The Semantic Web’s vision of “web of data” remains challenging. Originality/value: This study developed data integration from various institutions, including those of the LAM community. The development was conducted based on the mode of non-institution members (i.e. institutional outsiders). The challenges encountered included uncertain data quality and the absence of institutional participation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Many governments are examining the move to a unified patient centric healthcare system to reduce costs and improve healthcare services. This would provide clinicians (A Clinician is a healthcare professional who deals directly with a patient, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, specialists and first responders.) with a holistic view of all patient data. Combined with increases in patient data generated by advances in medical devices, it allows the extract of more information increasing recall, but it requires great cognitive effort to identify relevant information. This additional effort will exasperate the impact of the trend of decreasing time clinicians have to interact with their patients. It raises the risk to clinicians of cognitive overload. This paper proposes a solution that presents clinicians with the most relevant patient healthcare data based on the clinicians role and the healthcare scenario. The goal is to provide the clinician a more efficient method to determine the proper treatment. This proposal is applicable to current scenarios where the key relevant data is readily available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Access to e-Government data is challenging due to the heterogeneity and complexity of the public information ecosystem. Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) provide a key to disclosing the potential of Open Government data, by supplying common terms for marking up metadata and data in a consistent and coherent way. However, quality information is needed to help public institutions decide whether to adopt an existing or newly created CV. The paper discusses how to evaluate and document CV quality thus facilitating a comparison of different controlled vocabularies based on contextual information. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to assess the overall quality and rank of a controlled vocabulary, by integrating various quality dimensions according to the decision maker's needs. A set of e-Government controlled vocabularies that facilitate the semantic interoperability of e-Government data are selected as a testbed, and updated quality values are made available as Linked Data. Multi-step guidelines are also defined promoting and complementing the adoption of W3C recommendations to provide machine-readable quality metadata. This fosters reliability and re-usability by providing consumers with information on the assessment process carried out and the outcomes achieved. We illustrate the application of these guidelines by focusing on provenance and quality documentation. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - By 2020, an individual is expected to own an average of 6.58 devices that share and integrate a wealth of personal user data. The management of privacy preferences across these devices is a complex task for which users are ill-equipped, which increases privacy risks. In this paper we propose an approach that exploits Semantic Web (SW) technology to manage the user's IoT privacy preferences and negotiate the permissions for data sharing with third parties. SW technology comprises a web of data that can be processed by machines through a formal, universally shared representation. In our approach, SW enables a lightweight and interoperable communication between a Personal Data Manager (PDM) and the Third Parties (TPs) that request access to the user's personal data. The PDM can handle multiple heterogeneous personal IoT devices and manages the negotiation process between the user and the TPs in a way that can relieve users from the burden of specifying their privacy requirement for each TP. The core of the approach is the definition of the Privacy Preference for IoT (PPIoT) Ontology which is based on the Privacy Preference Ontology, the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology, the Fair Information Practices (FIP) principles, and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques for privacy protection in the IoT. This ontology aims to capture the complexity of privacy management in the IoT paradigm in light of the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. Along with presenting the ontology, in this paper we will provide an example on how to use the PPIoT ontology for the management of privacy preferences in the fitness IoT domain and we will show how the PDM handles the process of negotiation between the user and the TPs. The approach is based on an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model (PPM) that meets the requirements of the GDPR to have transparent and simple TP privacy policies. Finally, we will report the results of an evaluation on a mockup fitness app that implements this PPM. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) to propose an ontology for privacy preference in the IoT context, which covers a knowledge gap in existing literature and can be used for IoT privacy management, (ii) to propose an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model, which is in accordance with the GDPR objectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With an ever-increasing data over the internet, efficient information retrieval of data for its users has always been on stake. The issue is deeper when it comes to e-governance based real estate scenario, where there is a lack of interoperability found in buying and selling of property formats and loads of miscellaneous legal terminology that fetches inappropriate legal documentation for the users. Hence in today's Semantic web scenario, a Real estate ontology has been proposed under the Real Estate Information Retrieval Model and the model is evaluated by applying various information retrieval measures. This paper shows the implementation and analysis of various popular information retrieval metrics, be it a set retrieval or rank retrieval that can be used for performance evaluation of web retrieval of data. The proposed system depicts better results in almost all the metrics as compared to the initial user query set. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - This paper proposes an approach and demonstrates its application for cross- border exchange of clinical documents oriented towards the use of archetype concepts and international patient summary standards adopted in the European Union. A novelty in this approach is the management of native XML instances of an archetype concept in the CEN 13606 standard by means of a native XML database and XML technologies. The computer experiments demonstrate that it is suitable for representing relatively small clinical datasets such as those describing rare diseases like the Acromegaly illness, where the semantic context in the relatively small number of symptoms is practicable to tag in terms of SNOMED-CT terminology codes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the semantically enriched information model can facilitate secondary use of clinical data by visualizing the execution of queries based on standard terminologies. Finally, the compatibility of the information model with the IPS standard enables sharing of clinical data among different information models. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

AB  - Interoperability has become a cornerstone for the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT infrastructures that rely on the Web have become pervasive, by either publishing their data or enabling their remote management through it. The interoperability at the semantic level provides an environment in which the heterogeneities of the different IoT infrastructures are wrapped, and, therefore, systems can interact transparently. Achieving full interoperability requires the implementation of three layers: the technical, the syntactic, and the semantic layer. Furthermore, query-based transparent discovery and distributed access of IoT infrastructures can be implemented on top of these interoperability layers. In this chapter, the implementation of these three layers, with focus on the semantic layer, is discussed, as well as, the implementation of the interoperability services that provide transparent discovery and access of IoT infrastructures on the Web. At the end of each section, a reader can find examples from the EU project VICINITY that describe and demonstrate real-world showcases for the theoretical concepts explained. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - e-Government enables big data analytics to support decision processes in governing. C4ISR (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) is essentially e-Government scoped to military decision processes. The value of big data and its challenges are common to both. High variety and demand for veracity compel domain expertise-specific data analysis, and increasing volume and velocity hinder data analytics at scale. These conditions challenge even highly automated methods for comprehensive cross-domain analytics, and motivate cognitive approaches such as underlie Autonomous Systems (AS) aimed at C4ISR. a C4ISR framework is examined by parts, linking each C to ISR capability, and a taxonomy of analytics is extended to include cognitive autonomy enablers. Coupling these frameworks, the authors propose an extension of cognitive approaches for autonomy in C4ISR to e-Government in general and outline a research agenda for attaining it. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - As of today, to cope with traditional maintenance policies such as reactive and preventive maintenance, the manufacturing companies need the deployment of adaptive and responsive maintenance strategies. Meanwhile, the advent of Industry 4.0 leads the maintenance paradigm shift facilitated by the efficient monitoring of physical assets and forecasting of the potential risks. As the advanced maintenance policies benefit in terms of cost-efficiency, inventory management and reliability management, most of the manufacturing companies are trying to make their own advanced maintenance strategies and to elaborate on the development of an innovative platform for it. However, since advanced enabling technologies collect a huge amount of data from different data sources such as machine, component, document, process and so on, data federation should necessarily be achieved for further discussion, but manufacturing companies are immature to address this issue. H2020 EU project ZBRE4K, i.e., Strategies and predictive maintenance models wrapped around physical systems for zero-unexpected-breakdowns and increased operating life of factories, deploys semantic technologies to address this issue. This paper deals with the debate on how to efficiently federate various data formats with the support of the semantic technologies in the context of maintenance. In addition, it proposes a maintenance ontology validated and implemented with an actor from European industry. © © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The International Patient Summary (IPS) comprises the essential clinical data that must be available in case an European citizen needs unscheduled or urgent health care while abroad. The implementation of cross- border exchange of IPS is among the highest priorities of the European commission. Detailed functional requirements and use cases have been elaborated in addition to a new IPS standard in recent years as part of the efforts for enabling interoperability in information exchange and continuity of care. This paper presents a practicable approach and a solution to the problem of achieving semantic interoperability among the IPS sources in the European union. A novelty approach in this paper is first to design and analyze the business process of the primary use case and after that to propose a solution. It allows to identify several activities that are out of the scope in the existing documents and at the same time require special attention at the stage of software implementation. The proposed solution makes use of the openEHR information model to represent the IPS standard dataset in terms of archetypes. This way we preserve the semantic context in clinical concepts as well as introduce interoperability among data providers. Moreover, it overcomes the severe drawback of the message paradigm, where every two communicating parties must apply transformation of existing data that is specific to their needs. The discussion considers a computer experiment with real data employing a fully functional web application for IPS cross-border exchange. © Proceedings of the 12th IADIS International Conference e-Health 2020, EH 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

AB  - Understanding, monitoring, and predicting the flow of knowledge between academia and industry is of critical importance for a variety of stakeholders, including governments, funding bodies, researchers, investors, and companies. To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry. We evaluated ResearchFlow on the task of forecasting the impact of research topics on the industrial sector and found that its granular characterization of topics improves significantly the performance with respect to alternative solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Ontologies play a key role in the Semantic Web, providing the machine-interpretable semantic vocabulary and serving as the knowledge representation and exchange vehicle. On top of ontologies, various functionalities can be supported, such as semantic integration, enrichment and reasoning to either further enhance or enrich them with additional information, or to deduct implicit knowledge out of the already annotated information. This paper presents a holistic semantic model employed within the CONNEXIONs EU-funded project that is aimed at semantically representing and reasoning about all pertinent notions derived from the analysis of high volumes of heterogeneous data with the goal to ultimately improve the capabilities of Law Enforcement Agencies in their fight against crime and terrorism. The proposed model enables the compound of various important aspects that resolve around several sources of information considered important in this context, including online sources that are often adversely exploited, as well information produced by Internet of Thing devices, such as sensors and cameras. © © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Open Government Data (OGD) has emerged as a radical paradigm shift and endeavor among government administrations across the world largely due to its promises of transparency, accountability, collaboration, civic participation, social innovation as well as data-driven value creation. Data service is a critical component for OGD which guarantees the availability of government data to users in the form of structured and machine-readable open datasets. Aspects such as usability, quality, and interoperability should be considered in building such open datasets. The diversity of data sets usually hampers unlocking the full potential value of data. Interoperability addresses the ability of open data platforms and data services to communicate, exchange and consume data, and to operate effectively together. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based technique enabling governmental organizations to identify their public data and publish them via well-defined interoperable data services. In this context, an Open Governmental Data Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) is designed and developed to fulfill this goal. As a case study, the constructed platform has been utilized and evaluated in the Tehran Municipality organization. The results show that applying the proposed approach leads to the creation of high-quality datasets achieving a high degree of interoperability. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Essential for digitalization all-as-a-service model causes the shift of state priorities from a simple provision of public information to the delivery of high-quality and efficient public services. This aspect brings a particular importance to the reengineering of public administration procedures aiming to provide public services at a new level. In this paper we propose the approach to the design and modernization of public services, as well as related business processes, which combines existing modeling methods with the enterprise architecture frameworks to ensure semantic interoperability not only at the data models level but using executable models of public service. We represent the method of public services development as semantic business processes in the context of enterprise architecture together with the results of its pilot implementation and evaluation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The Portuguese public administration is a highly regulated environment, where business processes are subject to strong requirements for records management. Therefore business metadata must be produced and maintained along with the regular business objects, to enable effective information exchange. In that sense, when entities of this domain engage in exchanges of information, it is helpful for those involved if also the metadata produced can be exchanged, which requires it to be commonly understood. This research proposes a Canonical Data Model that supports semantic interoperability in the Portuguese public administration, by defining a set of metadata elements for describing records. The proposed solution is compared against other related data models, and its qualities are assessed using the Bruce-Hillman metadata quality framework. Furthermore, the analysis of the proposed solution reveals the proposed model promotes semantic interoperability within the Portuguese public administration, by ensuring the information exchanged retains its original business context meaning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - There is growing interest in city and community scale energy efficiency goals across the US and around the world [1]. Forward thinking developers are expressing interest in developing methods to track the actual operations of new urban developments and campuses. Local governments and developers are exploring how to ensure that the built infrastructure, including buildings, transportation, energy generation and storage assets, is not only designed for energy efficiency, but operates efficiently as well. There is a need for city and district scale tools to support energy analysis from design through operations. Smart city data analytics is a growing area of interest in the smart city technology space. However, while there is enthusiasm for the concept of smart city energy analytics, there is a lack of common semantic data models, interoperable systems, and methods to collect data and support decision-making for operating multi-building city- and district-scale energy systems. Urban developers are asking broad questions about how such a system might be designed, built, valued, maintained, and optimized. This paper describes ongoing research to explore and define a City or District Energy Operations System (CityEOS). © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The paper deals with a problem of organizing the intellectual decision making support in innovative projects management based on the knowledge base. The urgency of the task directed on managing the economic systems innovative development in current competitive market conditions is substantiated. Existing approaches and tools to modeling and decision support in strategic management of the developed territorial systems are considered. The paper also introduces an approach to the knowledge base development for intellectual decision support in innovative project management, based on the ontological analysis of knowledge acquisition from various sources. The effective tools to forming the strategic planning innovative system at the regional level, which could ensure the integration of potential innovative projects and programs in the existing model of the reproduction process are presented. One of the main properties of knowledge management systems is emergence, due to which the interaction between specialists based on formalization of knowledge representation and processing in intellectual components development (ontology, knowledge base) contributes to the creation of new knowledge. An advantage of the ontology-based approach to innovation process management is the semantic integration of data and knowledge for the decision support system. It is proposed on the basis of ontological engineering to form a comprehensive tool to development of an integrated model for representing and processing of knowledge at various stages of the innovative projects management process. Further study logic involves development of an integrated ontology that combines a set of ontologies formed to describe the various fields of specialists knowledge in the field of innovative project management, which will provide a clear understanding of the subject concepts, as well as the rules and cases of decision-making based on them. The proposed approach to organizing the intellectual decision support system is focused on the use of public administration in determining the parameters of medium-Term development of the Russian Federation, as well as in development of measures and mechanisms for social, economic and budgetary policy. Increasing the degree of scientific validity and accuracy of the forecast estimates will reduce the risks in adoption and implementation of management decisions. In theoretical aspect it is proposed to develop at the regional level the territorial systems management models and to form the scientific foundation for further development and comprehensive utilization technology of adaptive management and imitation based on modern intelligent information technologies applied for solving the problem of strategies and programs justification in innovative development in Russian regions. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) has revolutionized the industrial sectors around the world. Industry 4.0, a digitalization endeavour by the government of Germany for the factories of the future, aims to create intelligent, self-organized, and self-optimized smart factories by combining the IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence together. Interoperability is one of the crucial aspects of Industry 4.0 which requires standardized information models and exchange mechanisms for heterogeneous platform integration. Despite the development of various industry standards, this still remains the biggest burden due to multiple protocols, technologies, and policies involved. A common understanding of data semantics can be helpful in mitigating such problem. This paper provides a detailed comparison between the modelling approaches of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its extension languages. The aim is to garner a common understanding between these two modelling frameworks in order to generate a standardized mapping between them for the purpose of interoperable industrial applications. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The European Legislation Identifier initiative (ELI) aims at bringing legislation into the global Web of data, to facilitate the access, sharing and interconnection of legal information. It proposes the creation of URI identifiers for legislation based on common components and the description of their metadata based on an ontology relying on FRBRoo; the ELI ontology includes in particular the description of the FRBR levels of abstraction, the needed date properties to describe legislation and links to relate legislative acts. Legislation metadata is thus viewed as a global graph of interconnected entities. While ELI tries to lower the entry barrier for legal publishers to disseminate structured metadata and currently counts 13 implementations, it is also facing challenges to progress towards its full potential: data quality, description of ELI datasets, alignment of thematic vocabularies or granular description of the text subdivisions. ELI has the potential to facilitate access to legal information by enabling unambiguous legal citations mark-up, giving legislation more visibility in major web search engines, describing early legislation drafts or facilitating the exchange of data between legal information systems. ELI is tightly connected to novel legal information system architectures, based on legal knowledge graphs; this style of architecture encourages legal publishers to move from a document-centric perspective towards a data-centric perspective, as exemplified by the Casemates in Luxembourg and the Cellar at the Office of Publications of the European Union. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This exploratory study examined Linked Data (LD) schemas/ontologies and data models proposed or in use by libraries around the world using MAchine Readable Cataloging (MARC) as a basis for comparison of the scope and extensibility of these potential new standards. The researchers selected 14 libraries from national libraries, academic libraries, government libraries, public libraries, multi-national libraries, and cultural heritage centers currently developing Library Linked Data (LLD) schemas. The choices of models, schemas, and elements used in each library's LD can create interoperability issues for LD services because of substantial differences between schemas and data models evolving via local decisions. The researchers observed that a wide variety of vocabularies and ontologies were used for LLD including common web schemas such as Dublin Core (DC)/DCTerms, Schema.org and Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as deprecated schemas such as MarcOnt and rdagroup1elements. A sharp divide existed as well between LLD schemas using variations of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) data model and those with different data models or even with no listed data model. Libraries worldwide are not using the same elements or even the same ontologies, schemas and data models to describe the same materials using the same general concepts. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Integrating information system in any domain for E-government is facing several problems, such as structural and semantic sharing in similar information for applications and services. In addition, representation across heterogeneous organizations. In this aspect, the semantic web played a dynamic role in sharing and managing knowledge sharing. Therefore, e-government services need to modeling, re-engineering governmental sharing, and processing to provide information delivery according to the citizen and locations. Semantic Web technology based on the ontology has brought promising solutions to the above engineering problems. This paper is ongoing for previous work presents a framework for generating semantic model ontologies in OWL syntax from a government service domain. However, current works employing OWL ontologies in e-government to the Semantic Web viewer, which implemented semantic sharing integration for e-government domains (Civil information, Health information, Education Information) ontology, which present the case of the State of Kuwait interoperability integration. The domain ontology is created using ontology knowledge-based editor Protégé and OWL-Viz. Thus facilitating to improve the knowledge sharing so that citizens can take more knowledge benefits from the e-government sharing. In addition, the ontology will be useful in the knowledge sharing of semantic e-government integration, and semantic Web applications. Thus facilitating the design of e-government systems that can be easily integrated and maintained. Web Protégé ontology can be easily sharing with a distributed group of users who can engage in collaborative authoring activities from wherever they happen to be logged in. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.

AB  - In the Industry 4.0 era digitalization of design and manufacturing processes is taking place. The aim of the Delphi4LED H2020 ECSEL RD project of the EU is to trigger such a transition in the solid-state lighting industry by developing testing and modelling methodologies aimed at multi-domain characterization of LED based products at different levels of integration along the SSL supply chain. Key to the support of the fully digitalized LED luminaire design process is the appropriate implementation of a chip level LED multi-domain model that can be used in design tools which are widely available both for SMEs and big international companies. In this paper, we present the latest implementation of BME's chip level multi-domain LED model and its application in an spreadsheet based simulation tool. The model has been successfully tested through the first demonstrator design of the Delphi4LED project. © 2019 STEF.

AB  - The transformation of society towards a digital economy and government austerity creates a new context leading to changing roles for both government and private sector. Boundaries between public and private services are blurring, enabling government and private sector to collaborate and share responsibilities. In Belgium, the regional Government of Flanders embedded the re-use of public sector information in its legislation and published a data portal containing well over 4000 Open Datasets. Due to a lack of interoperability, interconnecting and interpreting these sources of information remain challenges for public administrations, businesses and citizens. To dissolve the boundaries between the data silos, the Flemish government applied Linked Data design principles in an operational public sector context. This paper discusses the trends we have identified while ‘rewiring’ the Authentic Source for addresses to a Linked Base Registry. We observed the impact on multiple interoperability levels; namely on the legal, organisational, semantic and technical level. In conclusion Linked Data can increase semantic and technical interoperability and lead to a better adoption of government information in the public and private sector. We strongly believe that the insights from the past thirteen years in the region of Flanders could speed up processes in other countries that are facing the complexity of raising technical and semantic interoperability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Back in the 1990s, there were several barriers for accessing and using the spatial data and information necessary for environmental management and policy making in Europe. These included different data policies, encodings, formats and semantics, to name a few. Data was collected for, and applied to, domain specific use cases and comprehensive standards did not exist, all impacting on the re-usability of such public sector data. To release the potential of spatial data held by public authorities and improve evidence-based environmental policy making, action was needed at all levels (Local, Regional, National, European) to introduce more effective data and information management and to make data available for citizens’ interest. The INSPIRE Directive, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, directly addresses this set of problems. The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007, with full implementation in every EU Member State required by 2021. It combines both, a legal and a technical framework for the EU Member States, to make relevant spatial data accessible and reused. Specifically, this has meant making data discoverable and interoperable through a common set of standards, data models and Internet services. The Directive’s data scope covers 34 themes of cross-sector relevance as a decentralised infrastructure where data remains at the place it can be best maintained. A great deal of experience has been gained by public administrations through its implementation. Due to its complexity and wide scope, this is taking place in a stepwise manner, with benefits already emerging as important deadlines approached. Efficient and effective coordination are following the participatory approach established in its design. It is timely to reflect on 10 years of progress of the “cultural change” which the European Spatial Data Infrastructure represents. We therefore, consider the lessons INSPIRE is offering for those interested in joined-up and federated approaches to geospatial data-sharing and semantic interoperability across borders and sectors. The approach itself is evolving through this experience. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

AB  - Summary statistics are fundamental to data science, and are the buidling blocks of statistical reasoning. Most of the data and statistics made available on government web sites are aggregate, however, until now, we have not had a suitable linked data representation available. We propose a way to express summary statistics across aggregate groups as linked data using Web Ontology Language (OWL) Class based sets, where members of the set contribute to the overall aggregate value. Additionally, many clinical studies in the biomedical field rely on demographic summaries of their study cohorts and the patients assigned to each arm. While most data query languages, including SPARQL, allow for computation of summary statistics, they do not provide a way to integrate those values back into the RDF graphs they were computed from. We represent this knowledge, that would otherwise be lost, through the use of OWL 2 punning semantics, the expression of aggregate grouping criteria as OWL classes with variables, and constructs from the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), and the World Wide Web Consortium’s provenance ontology, PROV-O, providing interoperable representations that are well supported across the web of Linked Data. We evaluate these semantics using a Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of patient case information from the Genomic Data Commons, a data portal from the National Cancer Institute. © © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - A modeling methodology to speed up the design of luminaires composed of solid state light emitting devices has been elaborated in the Delphi4LED research project of the European Union. Starting with integrated and automated measurements of packaged LED devices in the electric, thermal and optical domain; the methodology provides SPICE like models, which besides the electrical properties also reflect the thermal and optical ones. The electrical and optical model is based directly on semiconductor physics, for precise modeling of the low-current and high-current decay of efficiency. The compact model of the thermal domain is based on the methodology defined in the previous DELPHI project. Measured data on the population are converted in an optimization process to best fit the model parameter sets. The paper presents the elaborated methodology and also outlines a new JEDEC standard encompassing multiple thermal test environments. © © 2019 ASME.

AB  - During the latest years, Smart City projects aimed at driving local governments towards the strong use of technologies to support a higher quality of urban spaces and a better offering of public services. From an information viewpoint, this means enabling different categories of users, including citizens, Public Administration (PA), utility and energy providers, to access the large amounts of data in multiple, heterogeneous Smart City data sources, by adopting new tools and methods to take decisions that might improve city daily life. Aggregation of urban data according to multiple perspectives through the definition of proper indicators enables urban data exploration at different granularity levels for distinct categories of users. Furthermore, Semantic Web technologies may be used to enable interoperability and improve data access. In this paper, we propose a Smart Living Ontology, to provide a semantic-enriched representation of city indicators. On top of the ontology and users’ characterisation, a Semantic Layer has been designed to enable personalised access to urban data. © © 2019 for the individual papers by the papers’ authors.

AB  - Handling an emergency requires the coordination and cooperation of several people and systems from various agencies and organisations, including the government and society in general. A wide range of heterogeneous data is managed by different stakeholders, thus demanding solutions to support integration issues such as interoperability and ambiguity. In a previous work, we proposed an ontology for Emergency Response Systems, called EDXL-RESCUER, in the scope of the RESCUER project. In this paper, we present the usage of this ontology in a data exchange solution (DILS: Data Integration with Legacy Systems), which aims to provide semantic interoperability between Emergency Response Systems, and the evolution of EDXL-RESCUER. To evaluate the proposed solution, EDXL-RESCUER & DILS, we performed two studies: (i) simulations using two real data sources, the Police Reports from Bahia Public Safety and Security Department, Brazil; and the Canadian Disaster Database; (ii) an emergency simulation at an Industrial Park in Bahia, Brazil. The results demonstrate the potential use of the EDXL-RESCUER as a common vocabulary to support semantic interoperability between emergency response systems. We also verified the feasibility of using the DILS solution in emergency management scenarios. Besides EDXL-RESCUER & DILS, a mapping and integration of concepts related to data exchange are presented. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The leaders of digitalization are developing digital government as a platform that stimulates public-private partnerships in the creation of innovative applications and services. The primary and permanent core of this platform is data, and it is the data ready for the information sharing and the provision of seamless public services. Growing digital world has formed the culture of interaction between government and society based on Open Data. The great importance has the ability of consumers to understand the meaning (semantics) determined by the provider, which is essential for the publication of Linked Open Data. The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability. Both data-centric and model-oriented approaches are fundamental for the digital transformation of public administration. In this paper, we give a brief review of the leading countries digitalization experience and use it to outline the criteria characterizing the implementation of a data-centric paradigm. We have conducted the study showing if Russian e-government is ready for the digitalization in terms of the following areas: (1) the practice of information sharing; (2) the preconditions for the shift to a data-centric and model-oriented paradigm; (3) the regulatory barriers of digital transformation. We believe that the lack of data-centricity can become a serious obstacle to fulfill the plans of the “Digital Economy of Russian Federation” program. Therefore, we give some recommendations to introduce the data-centric approach that would enable the use of disruptive digital technologies and support the development of digital government in Russia. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Big biomedical data has grown exponentially during the last decades and a similar growth rate is expected in the next years. Likewise, semantic web technologies have also advanced during the last years, and a great variety of tools, e.g., ontologies and query languages, have been developed by different scientific communities and practitioners. Although a rich variety of tools and big data collections are available, many challenges need to be addressed in order to discover insights from which decisions can be taken. For instance, different interoperability conflicts can exist among data collections, data may be incomplete, and entities may be dispersed across different datasets. These issues hinder knowledge exploration and discovery, being thus required data integration in order to unveil meaningful outcomes. In this chapter, we address these challenges and devise a knowledge-driven framework that relies on semantic web technologies to enable knowledge exploration and discovery. The framework receives big data sources and integrates them into a knowledge graph. Semantic data integration methods are utilized for identifying equivalent entities, i.e., entities that correspond to the same real-world elements. Fusion policies enable the merging of equivalent entities inside the knowledge graph, as well as with entities in other knowledge graphs, e.g., DBpedia and Bio2RFD. Knowledge discovery allows for the exploration of knowledge graphs in order to uncover novel patterns and relations. As proof of concept, we report on the results of applying the knowledge-driven framework in the EU funded project iASiS (http://project-iasis.eu/) in order to transform big data into actionable knowledge, paving thus the way for personalised medicine. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The paper illustrates a Linked Thesaurus Framework for the Environment, named LusTRE, to facilitate data sharing across different environmental disciplines. It provides a knowledge infrastructure of multilingual thesauri and code lists, interlinking them so that they can be used as one integrated linked data source. This multilingual thesaurus is published according to the Linked Data Best Practices and supports metadata compilation and data discovery for describing and finding Environmental geodata. A human readable web interface is provided for the exploitation of LusTRE as well as a set of web services for programmatic access to the knowledge infrastructure. LusTRE has been exploited within the European directive INSPIRE and SEIS piloting testbeds implemented within the EU project eENVplus in order to support cross-border and cross-domain data sharing. It is aimed at supporting multilingual data search and query refinement. In order to show how interlinked content can help users to more easily express metadata within Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI), LusTRE web services have been integrated within existing metadata editors and geoportals. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Recently, a large amount of Governments and public administrations data are stored on the Web in various file formats, mostly in the tabular data form such as Comma Separated Values (CSV) or Excel. CSV format is simple and practical, but it is difficult to express the relevant metadata such as data provenance, meaning of data fields, relationships between data fields, and user access approaches/rights, etc. In order to make the CSV data semantically structured, interoperable, accessible and reusable for various Web applications, they need to be extracted from the CSV files and converted into the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format that provides superior data assimilation and query functionality. In this paper, we focus on how the Semantic Web technologies are used to convert CSV data into RDF. Therefore, we present a method and techniques to parse the CSV file; the parsed CSV data are complemented with metadata annotations to generate the annotated tabular data model which is then converted into RDF triples. According to the conceptual correspondences between the CSV data model and RDF data model, we designed a set of algorithms to generate RDF triples from the CSV data. Our developed prototype tool, CSV2RDF, is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method through real-world CSV datasets. The implementation and experimental outcomes demonstrate that our pro-posed method is feasible to generate RDF data from CSV datasets, with satisfactory performance on any size of data sets. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.

AB  - There is a huge volume of data made openly available to the masses on Government data sites such as the www.data.gov.in. However, it is very difficult to make sense between data from two different data sets or different domains. As a result a lot of time is spent in just collecting and linking this data from various sources before it can be put to use. A potential solution to this problem is using a Common Data Model. A Common Data Model is a data silo or warehouse which can accommodate any data from any source in one pre-designed format. In this paper we discuss an ETL process that allows users to remodel and store data, and a proposed schema for a Common Data Model which will house this transformed data under one roof. We also perform our own analysis on the proposed data model for a particular use-case; state-wise statistics of data related to pregnancy in India. Thus we prove that the common data model is able to integrate data from different sources and facilitate cross domain analysis and linking of data. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Accessibility of information in the web is the main feature in knowledge acquisition. Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization. It defines the terms with specified relationships between them, and can interpret by both humans and computers. Currently, E-Government is facing several problems relating for integration of the information systems, extraction, and representation across heterogeneous organizations. In Addition, e-government is the civil and political conduct of the government, which involves using information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, e-government services need to provide information where format and methods of delivery adapt according to the users and situations. In recent years, semantic Web technologies based on ontology have brought about promising solutions to the above engineering problems. In this paper, we propose a semantic-based framework for e-government. In addition, the platform Protégé for semantic ontology development is introduce. We proposed ontological model for the Education ministry domain and Medicine ministry domain. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) represents this ontology, which is the standard language for the semantic web. Moreover, it was testing in proposed semantic framework. The ontology will be useful in the knowledge of the e-government semantic integration, and semantic Web applications. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.

AB  - National Spatial Data Infrastructure-India (NSDI India), has been implemented as a network of spatial data nodes established in various data providing agencies in central and state governments towards improving access to geospatial data by all stakeholders. A set of geospatial data and process standard specifications from Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Standardization Organization (ISO) have been adopted to facilitate interoperable sharing of and access to data amongst organizational data nodes and end-users. Standards-based Web Map Services (WMS) are accessible from data providing agencies for use in the development of GIS applications. Efforts are afoot to reengineer and maintain available data sets for provision of Web Feature Services (WFS) for improving access to processable feature data sets with stakeholders. Collaborative preparation and maintenance of an authoritative, seamless and nationally consistent set of high-resolution National Foundation Spatial Data (NFSD) has been an important priority for NSDI to overcome problems in integration of data sets from multiple data nodes. Several national- and state-level policies have been in place to provide the required governance framework. Delays in data cleaning and reengineering; inefficient data/metadata update; absence of registry and catalogue service to support search and discovery; nonavailability of a common application development platform; delays in onboarding of data services/applications; insecurity of the cyberspace; lack of technical capacity amongst end-users; and absence of skilled personnel for building and maintaining data nodes have been some of the impediments before NSDI’s effective utilization. National Data Registry (NDR) to support registration, search and discovery of data services; application development on a cloud-based processing platform; development of ontologies for ensuring semantic interoperability amongst data nodes; and deployment of advanced cybersecurity tools for preventing cyberattacks; and R&D in geospatial ontologies, 3D SDI and geoanalytics constitute a part of the NSDI’s strategy for the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

AB  - The result of the EU is a complex, multilingual, multicultural and yet united environment, requiring solid integration policies and actions targeted at simplifying cross-language and cross-cultural knowledge access. The legal domain is a typical case in which both the linguistic and the conceptual aspects mutually interweave into a knowledge barrier that is hard to break. In the context of the ISA2 funded project “Public Multilingual Knowledge Infrastructure” (PMKI) we are addressing Semantic Interoperability at both the conceptual and lexical level, by developing a set of coordinated instruments for advanced lexicalization of RDF resources (be them ontologies, thesauri and datasets in general) and for alignment of their content. In this paper, we describe the objectives of the project and the concrete actions, specifically in the legal domain, that will create a platform for multilingual cross-jurisdiction accessibility to legal content in the EU. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Ageing is a complex multidimensional and multifactorial process associated with the decline in multiple physiological systems which can lead to frailties and disabilities over the lifespan. With the aim of supporting healthy older adults in order to sustain their wellbeing and capacity to live independently, the NESTORE project was recently funded by the EU Commission. In order to take into account the complex interactions among different aspects involved in the ageing processes, a model of healthy ageing was developed in NESTORE. This model included three core dimensions related to older people wellbeing (Physical/Physiological, Nutritional, Cognitive/Mental/Social). The NESTORE model was intended to provide a structured arrangement of the knowledge coming from such different domains in order to provide a simplified pool of information for: (i) the characterization of the older adults, (ii) the personalization of the coaching plans and (iii) the implementation of an effective ICT system. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The paper presents the Public Multilingual Knowledge Management Infrastructure (PMKI) action launched by the European Commission (EC) to promote the Digital Single Market in the European Union (EU). PMKI aims to share maintainable and sustainable Language Resources making them interoperable in order to support language technology industry, and public administrations, with multilingual tools able to improve cross border accessibility of digital services. The paper focuses on the main feature (interoperability) that represents the specificity of PMKI platform distinguishing it from other existing frameworks. In particular it aims to create a set of tools and facilities, based on Semantic Web technologies, to establish semantic interoperability between multilingual lexicons. Such task requires to harmonize in general multilingual language resources using standardised representation with respect to a defined core data model under an adequate architecture. A comparative study among the main data models for representing lexicons and recommendations for the PMKI service was required as well. Moreover, synergies with other programs of the EU institutions, as far as systems interoperability and Machine Translation (MT) solutions, are foreseen. For instance some interactions are foreseen between PMKI and MT service provided by the EC but also with other NLP applications. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

AB  - In this paper we report on the experience gathered in producing two goldstandard alignment datasets between the European Union thesaurus EuroVoc and two other notable resources adopted in legal environments: the thesaurus of the Italian Senate TESEO and the IATE European terminological resource. The realization of these two resources has been performed in the context of the PMKI project, an European Commission action aiming at creating a Public Multilingual Knowledge management Infrastructure to support e-commerce solutions in a multilingual environment. As of the numerous lexical and terminological resources involved in this project, ontology and thesaurus alignment and, as a consequence, the evaluation of automatically generated alignments, play a pivotal role for the success of the project. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Since agriculture is the oldest industry in our society and the basis of our life and economics, knowledge of crops as product of agriculture is also old and spread all over the society. As a result, the names of crops are messy and sometimes inconsistent. It is problematic in the digital and Internet era since interoperability is not assured. In this paper, we proposes Crop Vocabulary (CVO) as the core vocabulary of crop names to solve interoperability and machine-readability on crop names. There are many vocabularies about crops by various food chain stakeholders. Here we picked up three vocabularies issued by Japanese government with respect to food security, namely the Agricultural chemical use reference, the Agricultural chemical residue reference, and the Food composition database, since food security is the primary concern of all food chain stakeholders including farmers and consumers. As the result of comparative analysis of these vocabularies, we defined the concept of crop as the botanical information such as the scientific name of species with additional information such as edible parts, cultivation methods and usage. According to the definition, we investigated these three vocabularies and identified 1,249 crops with unique names. The element of CVO contains the information about the crop itself such as synonym, English name and scientific name as well as links to names in the above-mentioned vocabularies and other external vocabularies such as Wikipedia, AGROVOC and NCBI Taxonomy. We develop web-based API for CVO and an application for the farm management as an example. The value of CVO as a core vocabulary in the field of agriculture is identified by compatibility with existing vocabularies and its usefulness is demonstrated by web services applications developed based on CVO. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - At present, a large number of information systems have been created that operate productively and provide information support of specific functions. Currently, a topical issue is to unite these information systems, create favourable conditions for their information interaction. This task is particularly important for the creation of an information infrastructure in the electronic government, which involves both large-scale state systems and applications automating local functions. The main part of system interoperability is defined by semantics – tools for transfer of meaningful data, information. Semantics in information space is defined by two components: identification of objects and NameSpace. In different information spaces the problem of semantics provision is solved in a customized way. In semantic web, it is possible to use standard NameSpaces, or create your own one. An automatically generated URI is used as identifiers. There are alternative options to reproduce semantics in the framework of information infrastructure. In practice, there are cases where identifiers are a profound business key containing information about individual elements of business logic, the result of which is the object described. The article describes examples of such practice and shows elements of the methodology for creating such identifiers. The second semantics element is the namespace. In this field, serious groundwork has been made in different economy sectors. There is a tendency of interaction between separate dictionaries and development of uniform approaches. This can be implemented through creation of templates. Currently, the prerequisites for combination of two elements of semantics definition are fulfilled: identifiers and namespaces. This would make it possible to move quickly towards the creation of an e-government information infrastructure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - In an EU-funded project RICHFIELDS, a data platform was designed with the aim to collect, link and harmonize, analyze, store, and deliver food- and nutrition-related data and information to various stakeholders. To integrate heterogenous food data sets, we propose a RICHFIELDS framework for semantic interoperability of food information, which is a combination of already developed NLP approaches for the food domain. The framework includes i) a food ontology to which foods are linked, ii) a part that explains how the relevant foods can be extracted and represented in a structured way, and iii) a similarity measure that is used to link the foods to the ontology. To evaluate the RICHFIELDS framework, we selected two distinct data sets from different food information systems. The experimental results provided promising results,i.e., 81.5% and 87.5% of the foods from the first and the second data set, respectively, obtained a tag from the ontology (i.e., semantic annotation was performed). The annotations provided by the framework allow automatic integration of food information provided in both data sets. © © 2018 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The PMKI project is an European Commission action aiming to create a public multilingual knowledge management infrastructure to support e-commerce solutions in a multilingual environment. Such infrastructure will consist in a set of tools able to create interoperability between multilingual classification systems (like thesauri) and other language resources, so that they can be easily accessible through a Web dissemination platform and reusable by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), as well as by public administrations. In this paper the standards used to represent language resources and a methodology for automatic mapping between thesauri, based on an information retrieval framework, are presented. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - In the absence of a single entity that develops all systems for government, there is need to support a common understanding of the development environments such that new products can easily be integrated within existing services. Owing to the size of governments, different departments tend to conceive and develop services independently and yet they serve the same citizens. These services should be consistent regardless of which entity is providing the service. This paper proposes a National Enterprise Architecture (NEA) to support the implementation of an e-government interoperability framework (e-GIF). The architecture is driven by a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) model and uses ontologies to provide semantic interoperability. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.

AB  - SEO-DWARF (Semantic Earth Observation Data Web Alert and Retrieval Framework) is a project funded by the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The main objective of the project is to realize the content-based search of Earth Observation (EO) images on an application specific basis. The satellite images, which come from EO satellites such as Sentinels 1, 2 and 3, as well as ENVISAT, are distributed with few correlated meta-data which do not describe the phenomena and the objects included in the image. Innovative approaches to process remote sensing images can extract relevant information which semantically describes the land type, the region area border, objects and events such as oil spill. This information can be modeled as structured information through ontologies to be processed by algorithms to perform information retrieval and filtering. The proposed system is aware of the semantic elements which are relevant for final user and will be able to answer natural language queries such as "Show me the images of the Mediterranean Sea which include an algal bloom". The possibility to retrieve a specific set of land images starting from a query expressed by a final user can quickly increase the interoperability and the diffusion of applications able to efficiently use EO data. In this work, we present a brief overview of the most successful application of this formalization strategy focusing on the tools and approaches for creating a robust and efficient domain geo-ontology. Furthermore, we describe the approach adopted to define the specific ontology used in the SEO-DWARF project, including the strategy adopted for implementing and populating it. © 2018 SPIE.

AB  - The H2020 Mineral Intelligence Capacity Analysis (MICA) project is a collaboration between multiple geological surveys (BRGM, BGS, GEUS, GeoZS) in Europe; the European Raw Materials Intelligence Capacity Platform (EU-RMICP) enables the user to find information about mineral raw material in Europe. This paper discusses a part of EU-RMICP platform based on the models and the Web of data architecture. This part of the platform focusing on mineral resources, methods and information collected in different European data-bases, to leverage semantic technologies and to manage and link geoscience information and resources. Experts deal with many representations by taking into account the environmental, technical, political and social dimensions, metadata, heterogeneous data sources and tools. Our solution for semantic interoperability between different resources, is based on semantic annotation by adding knowledge to resources with semantic tags. The semantics attached to resources is defined by ontology and the exploitation is made with an integrated model, which maps the correspondence between the ontology and the resources. The ontology is based on an ontology of the domain of mineral resources coupled with relative commodities, time and space. The study focuses on the topic of semantic modeling, exploratory data, ranking the queries results and the query of linked data are introduced through Euro-Lex datasets. The architecture is based on a RDF triple store storing the ontology, the methods and documentation, the scenarios and metadata. The triple store is connected with eight existing European Data bases, and with the inference engine to search, select, infer and rank the results. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Smart Cities aim to create a higher quality of life for their citizens, improve business services and promote tourism experience. Fostering smart city innovation at local and regional level requires a set of mature technologies to discover, integrate and harmonize multiple data sources and the exposure of effective applications for end-users (citizens, administrators, tourists..). In this context, Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data principles provide a means for sharing knowledge about cities as physical, economical, social, and technical systems, enabling the development of smart city services. Despite the tremendous effort these communities have done so far, there exists a lack of comprehensive and effective platforms that handle the entire process of identification, ingestion, consumption and publication of data for Smart Cities. In this paper, a complete open-source platform to boost the integration, semantic enrichment, publication and exploitation of public data to foster smart cities in local and national administrations is proposed. Starting from mature software solutions, we propose a platform to facilitate the harmonization of datasets (open and private, static and dynamic on real time) of the same domain generated by different authorities. The platform provides a unified dataset oriented to smart cities that can be exploited to offer services to the citizens in a uniform way, to easily release open data, and to monitor services status of the city in real time by means of a suite of web applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - One of interesting problems, arising with deployment of large-scale systems, is integration of its nodes (systems / devices). In this work, we discus how to apply semantic technologies, as a mechanism to support node integration and facilitate interoperability within the developed ecosystem. We focus on pragmatic aspects of the proposed solution, discussed from the perspective of the Dependable Embedded Wireless Infrastructure (DEWI) EU project. In this context, a brief analysis of typical integration problems and reasons to apply solution based on semantic technologies is presented. Moreover, the integration procedure is outlined. Here, the key aspect that is discussed in considerable detail, is conversion from the DEWI nodes (based on a traditional relational database approach) towards universal cooperative nodes, which use semantic technologies. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In the last few decades, functional trait-based approaches have undergone an extraordinary expansion in phytoplankton ecology, due to the relative simplicity and the well-defined traits that determine the ecological niche of these organisms. A large quantity of heterogeneous and distributed data has been produced on phytoplankton traits and their use could be made more effective and efficient if data harmonization and interoperability would be improved. The use of controlled vocabularies and thesauri is an acknowledged good practice to establish the foundation for semantic interoperability, a critical requirement for reuse and sharing of data. In fact, thesauri, collectively constructed, bypass ambiguity issues in natural language, facilitating the identification and integration of the information available in multiple data sources and allowing both scientists and computer applications to interpret more effectively the meaning of data. Here we present a semantic resource on phytoplankton functional traits: the PhytoTraits thesaurus (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/index.php). PhytoTraits is the result of the interdisciplinary collaboration of experts both from the phytoplankton functional domain and from information and communication technologies, working together within LifeWatch Italy, the Italian node of the e-science European infrastructure for biodiversity and ecosystem research. PhytoTraits is the first initiative to deal with the semantics of phytoplankton functional traits, focusing on morpho-functional traits towards standardized bio-volume assessment. It reflects the agreement of a scientific expert community to fix semantic properties (e.g. label, definition) of approximately 120 traits. Following semantic web standard technologies, the thesaurus was implemented in Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS), a common data model based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF). PhytoTraits is freely available online, it can be queried through a SPARQL endpoint (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/sparql.php) and is also accessible via API (http://thesauri.lifewatchitaly.eu/PhytoTraits/services.php) for integration with other systems. If adopted as a standard and rigorously applied and enriched by the scientific community, PhytoTraits, providing harmonized concepts with associated unique and resolvable URIs, has the potential to significantly reduce the barriers to data discovery, integration, and exchange. © 2017

AB  - Ontologies play a key role in semanticinteroperability projects, capturing the conceptualizationunderlying the various systems to be integrated. In the case oflarge information systems landscapes, a single monolithicontology often becomes hard to design and maintain. In thissetting, it is common to divide the ontological model inconsistently interlinked modular ontologies, forming anontology network. This paper explores the role of EnterpriseArchitecture (EA) models in defining the ontologies in anontology network. We report on an exploratory study in thescope of an e-Government interoperability project in the areaof public security. In the reported study, an EA model providesguidance in the modularization of the ontology network. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Informatics increases the yield fromneuroscience due to improved data. Data sharing and accessibility enable joint efforts between different research groups, as well as replication studies, pivotal for progress in the field. Research data archiving solutions are evolving rapidly to address these necessities, however, distributed data integration is still difficult because of the need of explicit agreements for disparate data models. To address these problems, ontologies are widely used in biomedical research to obtain common vocabularies and logical descriptions, but its application may suffer from scalability issues, domain bias, and loss of low-level data access. With the aim of improving the application of semantic models in biobanking systems, an incremental semantic framework that takes advantage of the latest advances in biomedical ontologies and the XNAT platform is designed and implemented. We follow a layered architecture that allows the alignment of multi-domain biomedical ontologies to manage data at different levels of abstraction. To illustrate this approach, the development is integrated in the JPND (EU Joint Program for Neurodegenerative Disease) APGeM project, focused on finding early biomarkers for Alzheimer’s and other dementia related diseases. © 2017 Cessac, Kornprobst, Kraria, Nasser, Pamplona, Portelli and Viéville.

AB  - Introduction The introduction of omics data and advances in technologies involved in clinical treatment has led to a broad range of approaches to represent clinical information. Within this context, patient stratification across health institutions due to omic profiling presents a complex scenario to carry out multi-center clinical trials. Methods This paper presents a standards-based approach to ensure semantic integration required to facilitate the analysis of clinico-genomic clinical trials. To ensure interoperability across different institutions, we have developed a Semantic Interoperability Layer (SIL) to facilitate homogeneous access to clinical and genetic information, based on different well-established biomedical standards and following International Health (IHE) recommendations. Results The SIL has shown suitability for integrating biomedical knowledge and technologies to match the latest clinical advances in healthcare and the use of genomic information. This genomic data integration in the SIL has been tested with a diagnostic classifier tool that takes advantage of harmonized multi-center clinico-genomic data for training statistical predictive models. Conclusions The SIL has been adopted in national and international research initiatives, such as the EURECA-EU research project and the CIMED collaborative Spanish project, where the proposed solution has been applied and evaluated by clinical experts focused on clinico-genomic studies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

The goal is to publish linked data amongst local governments which allows discovering, accessing and encouraging interoperability. In order to achieve efficient interoperability of information systems, linked data play an important role in relating data. Linked data use semantic web technologies to publish structured data on the web and set links between data. Structure data are encoded as RDF. Furthermore, the data model supports integration of data sources by a linking semantic vocabulary, which is an effective way of exchanging data on the web. We propose a new framework for Thai local government with linked data technology to relate data that was not previously linked to enable exposing, sharing, and connecting pieces of data, information, and knowledge on the semantic web using URLs, RDF, data model and ontology. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Organizing documents in the file system is one of the most tedious and thorny tasks for most computer users. Taxonomies based on hand made directory hierarchies still remain the only possible alternative for most small and medium enterprises, public administrations and individual users. However, both the limitations of the hierarchical organization of file systems and the difficulty of maintaining the coherence within the taxonomy have raised the need for more scalable and effective approaches. Desktop searching applications provide proprietary interfaces that enable content-based searching at the cost of having no control on the indexing and ranking of results. Semantic file systems, instead, leave users the freedom to manage the taxonomy according to their specific needs, but lose the standard file system features. In this paper we describe GFS (graph-based file system) a new hybrid file system that extends the standard hierarchical organization of files with semantic features. GFS allows the user to nest semantic spaces inside the directory hierarchy leaving unaltered system folders. Semantic spaces allow customized file tagging and leverage on browsing to guide file searching. Since GFS does not change the low-level interface to interact with file systems, users can continue to use their favorite file managers to interact with it. Moreover, no changes are required to integrate the semantic features in proprietary software. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Ontology has been applied in various problem domains such as health, agriculture, public administration and business management, to develop solution models for effective knowledge modelling. The models help define structures of knowledge components and their relationship among them within a problem domain that may provide better representation of a system design architecture. Such basic model of knowledge components can provide a transparent approach for enhancing design thinking and comprehension for both users and system developers. This makes the ontology technique as one of the prominent techniques for designing system solution in a context-sensitive manner. In this paper, we describe the use of ontology in two design cases for representing the problem universe of discourse. First design case is on a record management system and second case is on a decision support system. For both system design cases, the ontology technique provided benefits for gaining semantic integration and interoperability in designing the solutions. Findings from our studies suggest that ontology enables provisions both to end users and to system developers for achieving design goals that in turn maximize various user benefits. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Semantic Web technologies and in particular Linked Open Data provide a means for sharing knowledge about cities as physical, social, and technical systems, so enabling the development of smart city applications. This paper presents a prototype based on the case of Catania with the aim of sharing the lessons learnt, which can be reused as reference practices in other cases with similar requirements. The importance of achieving syntactic as well as semantic interoperability – as a result of transforming heterogeneous sources into Linked Data – is discussed: semantic interoperability is solved at data level in order to ease further development on top. We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance. Domain practitioners and general members of the public have been asked to play with the prototype, and fill out a survey with questions and feedbacks. A computational experiment has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of our data model in terms of practical scalability over increasing data and efficiency under complex queries. All produced data, models, prototype and questionnaire results are publicly accessible online. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article describes the requirements for a decision support system which is designed to assess the quality of public services. Requirements for a decision support system are used as a starting point at its design stage and determine the functions of the developed system without showing the mechanism of its implementation. At the same time, the requirements serve as constraints in the process of system development. The set of the developed requirements for the decision support system includes basic, functional, non-functional and economic requirements. We propose to use the ontological approach in the development of requirements for the system. This allows us to solve a number of problems arising from the description of the requirements in natural language: the lack of exposition clarity, misrepresentation of the requirements and so on. The ontological model allows developers to interpret the requirements in the same way, to structure the specification of requirements for the system and to eliminate blurring in their definitions. Ontological representation of knowledge about requirements for the developed system and about the system providing public services in general is used for the semantic integration of existing information resources, appropriate interpretation of the content of text documents and search queries presented in a natural language. The developed ontology improves the quality of user (stakeholder) interaction during the system operation. In addition, it includes rules for term combination to provide reliable assertions on the state of the decision support system. © 2020 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.

AB  - It is widely agreed that rare disease patient registries should be international and follow the guiding principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) for humans and computers. Furthermore, the procedures to collect and exchange data should be harmonised. Since 2014, the Bring Your Own Data (BYOD) annual workshop has been organised by and held at the National Centre for Rare Diseases - Istituto Superiore di Sanitá (CNMR-ISS), Rome, Italy with the aim to promote the establishment of FAIR rare disease registries in compliance with IRDiRC and EU recommendations. The event has been arranged with the support of RD-Connect and ELIXIR, in particular, the Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences representative of ELIXIR-NL. The general roadmap of the BYOD workshop contains at least a preparatory phase, an execution phase, and a follow-up phase to foster the results of the workshop by surveying and having phone conferences with participants. At the 4th edition of the BYOD this year, held in September, there were twenty eight participants selected on the basis of their background, registry role, and involvement in European Reference Networks (ERNs). This edition took place in collaboration with or with the support of several additional organisations. This year the focus was on (i) the FAIRification process, with partially pre-prepared semantic models, (ii) FAIR data tools, and (iii) FAIR data management. A new element was a semantic model sketching exercise with the registry managers. At the beginning of the workshop, an overview of the FAIRification process and an introduction to four selected, scrambled, and anonymous sample datasets were provided. In the following sessions, the BYOD became highly interactive and the participants, split into four groups, went through the process of FAIRification step by step with break-out sessions alternated to plenary sessions in which participants presented the results of their group work. In the first step, each group discussed and drew a conceptual model of their assigned dataset, followed by a plenary session to discuss commonalities and complementarities. In the second step, the groups created an ontological model based on the conceptual model from the previous step which required ontology search. In the third step, the OpenRefine-FAIRifier tool and the metadata editor were used to aid in the creation of the machine readable format of the selected data. Then, to show the potential of data linkage, a cross resource question was executed over the four FAIRified sample datasets. The final part of the workshop was focused on a discussion about FAIR data management. Based on our experience from the previous editions of the workshop, the new elements were: (i) in the preparatory phase only four heterogeneous datasets among those received were selected, ii) a breakout and plenary session at the end of each FAIRification step was introduced, (iii) a time slot was allocated for the self sketching the semantic model with pen and paper by the registry managers, (iv) a time slot was allocated to discuss FAIR data management and FAIR project planning. We concluded that the main objectives of the BYOD for registry managers were achieved. The participants were able to see the potential of a FAIR registry and this allowed them to get quicker responses to cross-resource questions improving the use of available information on rare diseases and accelerates research. In addition, participants had the chance to get further into the FAIRification process and understand the importance of data management planning when setting up a registry. As a final note, it is important to stress that the friendly environment and the high interactivity among the different players, i.e., data managers, researchers, clinicians, patient representatives, and IT-trainers, strongly contributed in making the BYOD workshop a success.

AB  - Cross-agency Information sharing is a basic feature of digital economy in public sector. Heterogeneous environment is inherent for the public sector as well as for other industries, which are ready to digital transformations. The application of integration methods should guarantee the achievement of unambiguous meaningful interpretation of data. The article represents comparative analysis of basic integration approaches: (1) classic interaction via mediators, (2) integrated data model (XML-based models implementation) and (3) semantic integration. We defined the advantages of semantic integration and confirmed the possibility to use semantic core as a basis for a digital health ecosystem. We implemented the example of semantic integration in healthcare within the project of Plekhanov Russian University of Economics named the "Center of semantic integration". © 2017 Yury M.

AB  - In 2015, Flanders Information started the OSLO2 project, aimed at easing the exchange of data and increasing the interoperability of Belgian government services. RDF ontologies were developed to break apart the government data silos and stimulate data reuse. However, ontology design still encounters a number of difficulties. Since domain experts are generally unfamiliar with RDF, a design process is needed that allows these experts to efficiently contribute to intermediate ontology prototypes. We designed the OSLO2 ontologies using UML, a modeling language well known within the government, as a single source specification. From this source, the ontology and other relevant documents are generated. This paper describes the conversion tooling and the pragmatic approaches that were taken into account in its design. While this tooling is somewhat focused on the design principles used in the OSLO2 project, it can serve as the basis for a generic conversion tool. All source code and documentation are available online. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for generating semantic model ontologies in OWL syntax from a government service domain. Firstly, the government service domain is analysed and domain ontology is constructed to capture its semantic content. Thereafter, a semiformal representation of the domain ontology is created with the ontology knowledge-based editor Protégé. Finally, the OWL ontology model is imported. This study aims at providing e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world, with an easy-to-use framework for practising semantic knowledge representation in e-government processes, thus facilitating the design of e-government systems that can be easily integrated and maintained. The other challenge when integrating information systems in any domain such as e-government is the challenge of interoperability. One can distinguish between three levels of interoperability: technical, semantic, and organisational. The technical aspect has been widely tackled especially after the ubiquity of internet technologies. © © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Semantic Web technologies have redefined and strengthened the Enterprise-Web interoperability over the last decade. Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to a set of best practices that empower enterprises to publish and interlink their data using existing ontologies on the World Wide Web. Current research in LOD focuses on expert search, the creation of unified information space and augmentation of core data from an enterprise context. However, existing approaches for publication of enterprise data as LOD are domain-specific, ad-hoc and suffer from lack of uniform representation across domains. The paper proposes a novel methodology called LinkED that contributes towards LOD literature in two ways: (a) streamlines the publishing process through five stages of cleaning, triplification, interlinking, storage and visualization; (b) addresses the latest challenges in LOD publication, namely: inadequate links, inconsistencies in the quality of the dataset and replicability of the LOD publication process. Further, the methodology is demonstrated via the publication of digital repository data as LOD in a university setting, which is evaluated based on two semantic standards: Five-Star model and data quality metrics. Overall, the paper provides a generic LOD publication process that is applicable across various domains such as healthcare, e-governance, banking, and tourism, to name a few.

AB  - This research deals with the problem of semantic integration of heterogeneous data, focusing on Open Government Data - OGD. However, because the composition of OGD is a very broad set of data sources, with a great diversity of syntactic representation, we need to employ data integration techniques that make possible to use the set of sources, not just isolated databases. Thus, we consider the ontologies as artifacts capable of providing semantic integration, facilitating the use and dissemination of OGD content. The current state of the research aims to delimit the focus on ontologies on finance, especially those of public domain and shared construction.

AB  - This paper describes the first phase of the Public Multilingual Knowledge Man-Agement Infrastructure (PMKI) ISA2 project. PMKI is meant to support enterprises, in particular the language technology industry, as well as public administrations, with multilingual tools able to improve cross border accessibility of digital services. In particular it aims to create a set of tools and facilities, based on Semantic Web tech-nologies, for establishing semantic interoperability between multilingual lexicons. A comparative study among the main data models for representing lexicons and recom-mendations for the PMKI service are reported. Moreover, the expected synergies with other programs of the EU institutions, as far as systems interoperability and machine translation solutions, are discussed.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to propose a method based on Linked Data and Semantic Web principles for composing microservices through data integration. Two frameworks that provide support for the proposed composition method are also described in this paper: Linkedator, which is responsible for connecting entities managed by microservices, and Alignator, which aligns semantic concepts defined by heterogeneous ontologies. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method is based on entity linking principles and uses individual matching techniques considering a formal notion of identity. This method imposes two major constraints that must be taken into account by its implementation: architectural constraints and resource design constraints. Findings: Experiments were performed in a real-world scenario, using public government data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and that, it leverages the independence of development and composability of microservices. Thereby, the data provided by microservices that adopt heterogeneous ontologies can now be linked together. Research limitations/implications: This work only considers microservices designed as data providers. Microservices designed to execute functionalities in a given application domain are out of the scope of this work. Originality/value: The proposed composition method exploits the potential data intersection observed in resource-oriented microservice descriptions, providing a navigable view of data provided by a set of interrelated microservices. Furthermore, this study explores the applicability of ontology alignments for composing microservices. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Managing complex aviation data can be a significant challenge for any enterprise - whether a government agency, airline, airframe manufacturer, or aviation service provider. To handle this challenge, data models are typically developed to characterize and manage the data generated, used, and stored by a given enterprise. Unfortunately, different data providers employ qualitatively different data models, and this gives rise to problems exchanging data across organizational boundaries. Over the past decade, these problems have motivated data producers and consumers to look toward standardized data exchange models to address data interoperability. In this paper we examine some of these standardized data exchange models and compare them with a new type of data model based on ontologies. Ontology models have emerged in recent years from a confluence of research in the artificial intelligence, semantic web, and information science communities. This paper introduces ontology models, provides several use cases for ontologies relevant to aviation data management, and summarizes state-of-the-art aviation prototype applications that utilize ontologies. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - E-science on the Web plays an important role and offers the most advanced technology for the integration of data systems. It also makes available data for the research of more and more complex aspects of the system earth and beyond. The great number of e-science projects founded by the European Union (EU), university-driven Japanese efforts in the field of data services and institutional anchored developments for the enhancement of a sustainable data management in Germany are proof of the relevance and acceptance of e-science or cyberspace-based applications as a significant tool for successful scientific work. The collaboration activities related to near-earth space science data systems and first results in the field of information science between the EU-funded project ESPAS, the Japanese IUGONET project and the GFZ ISDC-based research and development activities are the focus of this paper. The main objective of the collaboration is the use of a Semantic Web approach for the mashup of the project related and so far inoperable data systems. Both the development and use of mapped and/or merged geo and space science controlled vocabularies and the connection of entities in ontology-based domain data model are addressed. The developed controlled vocabularies for the description of geo and space science data and related context information as well as the domain ontologies itself with their domain and cross-domain relationships will be published in Linked Open Data. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Each government level uses its own different information system. At the same time citizens expect that these governmental levels adopt a user-centric approach and provide instant access to their data or to open government data. Therefore the applications at various government levels need to be interoperable in support of the 'once only-principle': data is inputted and registered only once and then reused. Given government budget constraints and the cost and complexity of (re)modeling, translating and transforming data over and over, public administrations need to reduce interoperability costs. This is achieved by semantically aligning information between the different information systems of each government level. Semantical interoperable systems facilitate citizen-centered e-government services. This paper illustrates how the Open Standards for Linked Organizations program (OSLO) paved the way bottom-up from a broad basis of stakeholders towards a government-endorsed strategy. OSLO applied a generic process and methodology and provided practical insights on how to overcome the encountered hurdles: political support and adoption; reaching semantic agreement. The lessons learned in the region of Flanders (Belgium) can speed-up the process in other countries that face the complexity of integrating information intensive processes between different applications, administrations and government levels.

AB  - Open Government Ontology proposed in this paper is an extensive ontology aimed at modelling a wide range of Open Government services. Semantic model of the Open Government opens possibilities for the integration with other semantic and information models, and enables semantic reasoning and resource discovery. Characteristics of the Open Government are transparency, participation and collaboration. Main components of the Open Government are Open Architecture, Open Data and Open Standards. Organizational structure of the Open Government consists of the internal government organizations, associated domains and Open (e)Government services. Open Government Ontology can be used as a semantic meta-data repository for the (e)Government and Open (e)Government services. Using formal methods of reasoning with the proposed ontology we can search for information about Open (e)Government services and infer on gathered knowledge. Also Open Architecture Ontology can be used as Information Architecture framework for the creation of these services as was the case regarding Montenegrin Semantic Science Network. © 2016, Strojarski Facultet.

AB  - Within the field of ocean science there is a long history of using controlled vocabularies and other Semantic Web techniques to provide a common and easily exchanged description of datasets. As an activity within the European Union, United States, Australian-funded project “Ocean Data Interoperability Platform”, a workshop took place in June 2014 at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to further the use of these Semantic Web techniques with the aim of producing a set Linked Data publication patterns which describe many parts of a marine science dataset. During the workshop, a Semantic Web development methodology was followed which promoted the use of a team with mixed skills (computer, data and marine science experts) to rapidly prototype a model ontology which could be iterated in the future. In this paper we outline the methodology employed in the workshop, and examine both the technical and sociological outcomes of a workshop of this kind. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Biobanks are the biological back end of data-driven medicine, but lack standards and generic solutions for interoperability and information harmonization. The move toward a global information infrastructure for biobanking demands semantic interoperability through harmonized services and common ontologies. To tackle this issue, the Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (MIABIS) was developed in 2012 by the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure of Sweden (BBMRI.se). The wide acceptance of the first version of MIABIS encouraged evolving it to a more structured and descriptive standard. In 2013 a working group was formed under the largest infrastructure for health in Europe, Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-ERIC), with the remit to continue the development of MIABIS (version 2.0) through a multicountry governance process. MIABIS 2.0 Core has been developed with 22 attributes describing Biobanks, Sample Collections, and Studies according to a modular structure that makes it easier to adhere to and to extend the standard. This integration standard will make a great contribution to the discovery and exploitation of biobank resources and lead to a wider and more efficient use of valuable bioresources, thereby speeding up the research on human diseases. Many within the European Union have accepted MIABIS 2.0 Core as the "de facto" biobank information standard. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.

AB  - The emergence of new applications that need to share information between different sources of information, such as e-learning, e-commerce, e-government, and electronic libraries requires interoperability between information systems. The information systems are designed and developed by different organizations to be autonomous and heterogeneous sources which lead to multiple structuring formats and different interpretations of the same data. So to simplify data access, the virtual integration of heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed data sources is required based on the couple mediator-wrapper and founded on ontologies that provide a consensual terminology. The mediator masks the heterogeneity and distributes the data sources, while the adapter accommodates queries to data sources formats. Information systems exchange data and services thanks to the rich context that the semantic web offers. It aims to provide data understandable by humans and machines that perform automatic processing by software modules following a semantic enrichment. This article is a survey of the state of art that compare the previous works according to several criteria. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) is driving the technology and advances of the Internet and every day it is becoming more popular to talk about IoT systems in multiple domains: Smart Cities, Agriculture, and Industrial Internet, etc. Increasingly, IoT systems will need to interact and be interconnected for offering the always-promoted everything-connected paradigm. Current IoT systems rely on semantic web technologies for integrating data and ensure web services interoperability. However there are yet a gap to ensure semantic interoperability among IoT systems. Most of the existing proposed (open) approaches and solutions lack on formal methodologies for interoperability in technology and standard format of the data. We studied and analyzed most available semantic-based IoT approaches to identify the main requirements hindering IoT semantic interoperability. In this paper, we present SEG 3.0 a methodology to federate, unify and provide semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 emerges from methodologies for ontology engineering and the idea of unification and federated systems. We propose SEG 3.0 and apply it to Internet of Things (IoT) and particularly on use cases for smart cities as proof of concept. Firstly, we define characteristics required for the methodology. Secondly, we describe the processes and the different formal steps. Thirdly, we provide a proof of concept framework and architecture applying this methodology, thus the benefits of using SEG 3.0 methodology in IoT domains are described. Finally, we demonstrate that the SEG 3.0 methodology is applied to three use cases: (1) the M3 framework to assist developers in designing semantic-based IoT applications, (2) the VITAL EU project for smart cities, and (3) the FIESTA-IoT EU project for IoT semantic interoperability. SEG 3.0 is a formal methodology generic enough to be applied to other domains than IoT and smart cities, since the main benefit of the SEG 3.0 is integrating heterogeneous data and adding value to it to build innovative applications. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Public administrations are often still organised in vertical, closed silos. The lack of common data standards (common data models and reference data) for exchanging information between administrations in a cross-domain and/or cross-border setting stands in the way of digital public services and automated flow of information between public administrations. Core data models address this issue, but are often created within the closed environment of a country or region and within one policy domain. A lack of insight exists in understanding and managing the life-cycle of these initiatives on public administration information systems for data modelling and data exchange. In this paper, we outline state-of-the-art implementations and vocabularies linked to the core data models. In particular we inventoried and selected existing core data models and identified tendencies in current practices based on the criteria creation, use, maintenance and coordination. Based on the analysis, this survey suggest research directions for policy and information management studies pointing to best practices regarding core data model implementations and their role in linking isolated data silos within a cross-country context. Finally we highlight the differences in their coordination and maintenance, depending on the state of creation and use. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Data management in the marine sciences faces the complex issue of addressing contrasting cognitive models across scientific domains, meaning the various representations that different communities build for overlapping areas of interest. Each of these communities constructs an identity on a specific and personal set of inherited backgrounds, practices, and tacit knowledge, which are mirrored in how they understand the targets of their studies. From a practical point of view, this can result in mis-linking observations and usage. This paper reports on the work done within the EU FP7 SeaDataNet project to tackle such problems through an integrated discovery and data access paradigm. It is based on a flexible metadata model that allows researchers to link domain-specific metadata profiles encoded using Sensor ML OGC standard, the general discovery framework based on an ISO 19115/19139 profile called CDI, and the data through a common hub based on the Observations and Measurements OGC standard. © 2016 - OGS.

AB  - Nowadays, in a knowledge-driven economy, the organizations, public or private, require to make an appropriate managing knowledge assets to sustain competitive edge in global markets or in governmental services. Advances in Information and Communications Technologies have supported innovations in Knowledge Management (KM). Since the KM has been recognized as one of the critical factors for obtaining organizational competitiveness. KM is among the promising areas for the application of Semantic Web. In this paper we propose an approach to the development of a technological platform for KM that integrates semantic Web technologies. This platform supports all processes required in knowledge management. Therefore, the platform enables the automatic identification of patterns and generation of the taxonomies from unstructured texts (documents). The platform consists of tools that allow storing documents (from a knowledge contributor interface), processing of source documents, i.e. identifying sentences, stop-words, identifying n-grams, and generating bags of words, denoting lexical patterns, taxonomic-relation extraction, and inference algorithms to retrieve knowledge from a set of repositories. These algorithms use the previous phases to retrieve knowledge more accurately derived from the semi-structured or structured information previously generated. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, Technological development of human beings is extremely related to information. This is proved on the manners and areas that life was computerized such as in trade, government services, medicine, education, learning etc.Nevertheless, the fast development of designing information systems has created several sub-systems in multiple contexts which are conceived by different communities and totally dispersed geographically but all undertaking the same area. Neither contents nor services that these subsystems are made are certainly in the same technology environments. In our research, the learning field goes through many key steps. Actually, new revolutionized practices were implemented due to technology innovation, so transition from classical learning towards distance learning or d-learning is more than possible, it’s desired. Consequently, this phenomenon has created more opportunities for learners and teachers but also several challenges; in many cases, the multitude of standards hinders the learner migration from a learning environment to another, so it hampers its learning development.In this paper, we will propose a framework of interoperability based on three levels. Since we are interested in semantic level, we propose a process of interoperability of learning content in the cloud era based on a global ontology. Like recommendation systems, we will start our process by acquisition, then validation and finally structuration of the learning content. This structuration way will give to both actors of learning environment a certain flexibility and access to other resources in Cloud environment. The basic principle is to collect content, to enrich it and to make it interoperable by using unified approach in star based on a comprehensive ontology.

AB  - This paper presents a functional classification plan supported on business processes for the Portuguese public administration as a tool to promote semantic interoperability. The author initiates discussion by presenting the classification of functional information, briefly reviewing literature to justify the classification of systems in archival information systems. Then, he presents the business plan classification and how it was constructed, to later conclude that it is a new approach not only in the organization, representation and retrieval of information/knowledge, but also in the management of archival information, making it a matrix model that links functions to business processes. Also, despite the importance of this tool, he recognizes the need to develop the business plan classification tool to an ontology based on WOL (Web Ontology Language), a language for knowledge representation, which has been proposed by W3C as a ‘standard’ to codify ontologies from the semantic web’s perspective. © 2016 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

AB  - EU and EPA have announced environmental regulations in order to reduce greenhouse gas since Internal Combustion Engine(ICE) Vehicle gas causes severe environment pollution. Global vehicle OEM & Tier 1 has continuously invested to develop eco-friendly car in order to satisfy the environmental regulations. The development includes not only the hybrid electric vehicles that uses motor as auxiliary driving source on top of internal combustion engine but also electric vehicles. There are many prediction that EV generation will come in near future through HEV generation.(1) Unlike traditional ICE Vehicle, e-Powertrain components such as Motor, Inverter, or battery directly affect EV’s distance and dynamic characteristic. Therefore, it should simulate, considered in early EV development phase. The objective of this research is promptly define of vehicle performance: NEDC distance, zero to 100kph time, max speed, and temperature of traction motor. © 2016, FISITA. All rights reserved.

AB  - Natural and man-made catastrophic events appear be steadily increasing in intensity and frequency. Proper preparation, response and recovery are essential if mankind and its vital systems are to cope with and survive large-scale disasters. The organisations responsible for delivering emergency response services often under-perform due to a lack of proper interoperation and collaboration. This paper discuss the interoperability issues for data interchange among first responders agency participating in emergency situation and provides exhaustive overview of the recent studies and attempts to solve the problem. The approach taken by the EU funded REDIRNET project for development of a core ontology enabling exchange of data among first responder agencies is presented. The novelty included in the ontology tree is described and the implementation in the meta-data gateway is introduced. The paper provides insight in the implementation of the REDIRNET platform and the designed semantic interoperable services. The paper ends with the discussion of the presented work and the concluding remarks.

AB  - After a thorough analysis of existing Internet of Things (IoT) related ontologies, in this paper we propose a solution that aims to achieve semantic interoperability among heterogeneous testbeds. Our model is framed within the EU H2020's FIESTA-IoT project, that aims to seamlessly support the federation of testbeds through the usage of semantic-based technologies. Our proposed model (ontology) takes inspiration from the well-known Noy et al. methodology for reusing and interconnecting existing ontologies. To build the ontology, we leverage a number of core concepts from various mainstream ontologies and taxonomies, such as Semantic Sensor Network (SSN), M3-lite (a lite version of M3 and also an outcome of this study), WGS84, IoT-lite, Time, and DUL. In addition, we also introduce a set of tools that aims to help external testbeds adapt their respective datasets to the developed ontology. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Linked data has the potential of interconnecting data from different domains, bringing new potentials to machine agents to provide better services for web users. The ever increasing amount of linked data in government open data, social linked data, linked medical and patients' data provides new opportunities for data mining and machine learning. Both are however strongly de-pendent on the selection of high quality data features to achieve good results. In this work we present an approach that uses ontological knowledge to generate features that are suitable for building a decision tree classifier addressing the specific data set and classification problem. The approach that we present has two main characteristics - it generates new features on demand as required by the induction algorithm and uses ontological knowledge about linked data to re-strict the set of possible options. These two characteristics enable the induction algorithm to look for features that might be connected through many entities in the linked data enabling the generation of cross-domain explanation models.

AB  - To protect the health of human and environment, the European Union implemented the REACH regulation for chemical substances. REACH is an acronym for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals. Under REACH, the authorities have the task of assessing chemical substances, especially those that might pose a risk to human health or environment. The work under REACH is scientifically, technically and procedurally a complex and knowledge-intensive task that is jointly performed by the European Chemicals Agency and member state authorities in Europe. The assessment of substances under REACH conducted in the German Environment Agency is supported by the knowledge-based system KnowSEC, which is used for the screening, documentation, and decision support when working on chemical substances. The software KnowSEC integrates advanced semantic technologies and strong problem solving methods. It allows for the collaborative work on substances in the context of the European REACH regulation. We discuss the applied methods and process models and we report on experiences with the implementation and use of the system. © 2016 Baumeister et al.

AB  - Although successfully employed as the foundation for a number of large-scale government and energy industry projects, foundational ontologies have not been widely adopted within mainstream Enterprise Systems (ES) data integration practice. However, as the closed-worlds of ES are opened to Internet scale data sources, there is an emerging need to better understand the semantics of such data and how they can be integrated. Foundational ontologies can help establish this understanding and therefore, there is a need to investigate how such ontologies can be applied to underpin practical ES integration solutions. This paper describes research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of such an approach through the development and application of the 4D-Semantic Extract Transform Load (4D-SETL) framework. 4D-SETL was employed to integrate a number of large scale datasets and to persist the resultant ontology within a prototype warehouse based on a graph database. The advantages of the approach included the ability to combine foundational, domain and instance level ontological objects within a single coherent system. Furthermore, the approach provided a clear means of establishing and maintaining the identity of domain objects as their constituent spatiotemporal parts unfolded over time, enabling process and static data to be combined within a single model. © © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The improvement and diversification of experimental technologies have caused a flood of data. In order to share and integrate such huge and diverse data, it is important to describe the relationship between data using Semantic Web technology. A goal of the Semantic Web is that computers can automatically process data by linking meaningful data and by forming a web of data. The Semantic Web consists of key technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), ontologies, triple stores (database for RDF), and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL), which is a query language for triple stores. Although the Semantic Web has been used by some specific domains such as government and media, recently it is also applied to the life sciences. In this chapter, I will describe about the Semantic Web and its application to life science including glycobiology. Finally, I will introduce TogoTable, which is a web application using the Semantic Web, used for collecting annotations from distributed databases. © Springer Japan 2017.

AB  - A major propelling technology for electronic government (e-Government) is the powerful concept of Semantic Web Service. Semantically enriched Web services promise to increase the level of automation and to reduce integration efforts significantly. On the other hand, and due to the heterogeneous structure of the public sector, the achievement of interoperability and integration is a key challenge for a comprehensive e-Government. Therefore, the combination of e-Government and Semantic Web Services is very much natural. In this paper, we present a dynamic approach for semantically composing e-Government Web services based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques. The overall objective of our approach is to improve the citizen centric e-Government vision by providing a platform for automatically discovering, composing and optimizing e-Government services. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The advancements in healthcare practice have brought to the fore the need for flexible access to health-related information and created an ever-growing demand for the design and the development of data management infrastructures for translational and personalized medicine. In this paper, we present the data management solution implemented for the MyHealthAvatar EU research project, a project that attempts to create a digital representation of a patient's health status. The platform is capable of aggregating several knowledge sources relevant for the provision of individualized personal services. To this end, state of the art technologies are exploited, such as ontologies to model all available information, semantic integration to enable data and query translation and a variety of linking services to allow connecting to external sources. All original information is stored in a NoSQL database for reasons of efficiency and fault tolerance. Then it is semantically uplifted through a semantic warehouse which enables efficient access to it. All different technologies are combined to create a novel web-based platform allowing seamless user interaction through APIs that support personalized, granular and secure access to the relevant information. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - According to the United Nations’ International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, “natural hazards are processes or phenomena that may cause loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage, loss of livelihoods and services, social and economic disruption, or environmental damage”. They are at the interface between human and natural systems. From this perspective, natural hazards are a multidimensional domain including environmental issues, the private and public sector and citizens and governance ranging from local to supranational. The vast amount of information and data necessary for comprehensive hazard and risk assessment present many challenges regarding the lack of accessibility, comparability, quality, organisation and dissemination of natural hazards spatial data. In order to mitigate these limitations, an interoperability framework has been developed and published in the INSPIRE Data Specification on Natural Risk Zones—technical guidelines (DS) document. This framework provides means for facilitating access, integration, harmonisation and dissemination of natural hazard data from different domains and sources. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the paper highlights the key aspects of the interoperability to the various natural hazard communities and illustrates the applicability of the interoperability framework developed in the DS. And secondly, the paper “translates” into common language the main features and potentiality of the interoperability framework of the DS for a wider audience of scientists and practitioners in the natural hazard domain. In this paper, the four pillars of the interoperability framework will be presented. First, the adoption of a common terminology for the natural hazard domain will be addressed. A common data model to facilitate cross-domain data integration will then follow. Thirdly, the common methodology developed to express qualitative or quantitative assessments of natural hazards is presented. Fourthly, the extensible classification schema for natural hazards developed from a literature review and key reference documents from the contributing community of practice is discussed. Furthermore, the applicability of the interoperability framework for the various stakeholder groups is illustrated. This paper closes discussing main advantages, limitations and next steps regarding the sustainability and evolution of the interoperability framework. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - To effectively integrate distributed and heterogonous open data now is an essential problem of Web research community. Due to rapidly development of open data, e.g. geographic, track, dynamic geospatial data, governments are required to release more and more data for academics and industry. The ubiquitous data are in various types and formats, e.g. number, graphic or specific format provided by different data sources, in distributed environment. All makes it difficult to integrate data to different domain. This paper proposes a data-flow integration mechanism with a unified description for distributed and heterogonous open data. Our approach starts with using Semantic Web technology and web ontology language (OWL), to define a data flow-oriented semantic description model. This supports a domain view description which is a user's aspect of domain. In this model, users are able to describe a domain view via three main components: 1) data unit, 2) link unit, and 3) domain unit. Final, we use earthquake disaster event as our example depict how the data flow-oriented semantic description model work conceptually. And our solution ensures data interoperability and provides a unified semantic description model to integrate heterogeneous data. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A good interaction between public administrations and citizens is imperative in modern smart cities. Semantic web technologies can aid in achieving such a goal. We present a smart urban fault reporting web platform to help citizens in reporting common urban problems, such as street faults, potholes or broken street lights, and to support the local public administration in responding and fixing those problems quickly. The tool is based on a semantic data model designed for the city, which integrates several distinct data sources, opportunely re-engineered to meet the principles of the Semantic Web and linked open data. The platform supports the whole process of road maintenance, from the fault reporting to the management of maintenance activities. The integration of multiple data sources enables increasing interoperability and heterogeneous information retrieval, thus favoring the development of effective smart urban fault reporting services. Our platform was evaluated in a real case study: a complete urban reporting and road maintenance system has been developed for the municipality of Catania. Our approach is completely generalizable and can be adopted by and customized for other cities. The final goal is to stimulate smart maintenance services in the "cities of the future".

AB  - Advances in the use of omic data and other biomarkers are increasing the number of variables in clinical research. Additional data have stratified the population of patients and require that current studies be performed among multiple institutions. Semantic interoperability and standardized data representation are a crucial task in the management of modern clinical trials. In the past few years, different efforts have focused on integrating biomedical information. Due to the complexity of this domain and the specific requirements of clinical research, the majority of data integration tasks are still performed manually. This paper presents a semantic normalization process and a query abstraction mechanism to facilitate data integration and retrieval. A process based on well-established standards from the biomedical domain and the latest semantic web technologies has been developed. Methods proposed in this paper have been tested within the EURECA EU research project, where clinical scenarios require the extraction of semantic knowledge from biomedical vocabularies. The aim of this paper is to provide a novel method to abstract from the data model and query syntax. The proposed approach has been compared with other initiatives in the field by storing the same dataset with each of those solutions. Results show an extended functionality and query capabilities at the cost of slightly worse performance in query execution. Implementations in real settings have shown that following this approach, usable interfaces can be developed to exploit clinical trial data outcomes. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - There is increasing need to use the widest range of data to address issues of environmental management and change, which is reflected in increasing emphasis from government funding agencies for better management and access to environmental data. Bringing together different environmental datasets to confidently enable integrated analysis requires reference to common standards and definitions, which are frequently lacking in environmental data, due to the broad subject area and lack of metadata. Automatic inclusion within datasets of controlled vocabulary concepts from publicly available standard vocabularies facilitates accurate annotation and promotes efficiency of metadata creation. To this end, we have developed a thesaurus capable of describing environmental chemistry datasets. We demonstrate a novel method for tagging datasets, via insertion of this thesaurus into a Laboratory Information Management System, enabling automated tagging of data, thus promoting semantic interoperability between tagged data resources. Being web available, and formatted using the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) semantic standard, this thesaurus is capable of providing links both to and from other relevant thesauri, thus facilitating a linked data approach. Future developments will see extension of the thesaurus by the user community, in terms of both concepts included and links to externally hosted vocabularies. By employing a Linked Open Data approach, we anticipate that Web-based tools will be able to use concepts from the thesaurus to discover and link data to other information sources, including use in national assessment of the extent and condition of environmental resources. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Background and objectives: Post-genomic clinical trials require the participation of multiple institutions, and collecting data from several hospitals, laboratories and research facilities. This paper presents a standard-based solution to provide a uniform access endpoint to patient data involved in current clinical research. Methods: The proposed approach exploits well-established standards such as HL7 v3 or SPARQL and medical vocabularies such as SNOMED CT, LOINC and HGNC. A novel mechanism to exploit semantic normalization among HL7-based data models and biomedical ontologies has been created by using Semantic Web technologies. Results: Different types of queries have been used for testing the semantic interoperability solution described in this paper. The execution times obtained in the tests enable the development of end user tools within a framework that requires efficient retrieval of integrated data. Conclusions: The proposed approach has been successfully tested by applications within the INTEGRATE and EURECA EU projects. These applications have been deployed and tested for: (i) patient screening, (ii) trial recruitment, and (iii) retrospective analysis; exploiting semantically interoperable access to clinical patient data from heterogeneous data sources. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The information explosion and subsequent problem of information overload has become more prominent in recent years. The situation can be aptly described by John Naisbitt's quote, 'We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge'. The information overload in intelligent systems has highlighted the restricted ability of knowledge representation (KR) formalisms to cope with various forms of uncertainty in knowledge. Probabilistic extensions of KR formalisms are the most investigated for uncertainty representation. Probabilistic extensions of formal logics offer expressiveness at the cost of tractability of reasoning. On the other hand Probabilistic extensions of graphical models makes simplifying assumptions to achieve better computational performance but are less expressive. In fact one of the most noted problem of probabilistic KR formalisms is the difficulty to achieve the expressiveness-of-representation vs tractability-of-reasoning trade off. In addition the KR formalism for open domains such as Semantic Web need to facilitate information sharing and semantic interoperability as well. Ontologies have already been successfully used as KR formalism as they facilitates semantic interoperability and therefore automated reasoning; one of the essentials to cope with information overload. However traditional ontologies cannot deal with uncertain knowledge. Probabilistic ontologies use probabilistic KR formalisms and therefore can cope up with domain uncertainty. This paper investigates the applicability of probabilistic ontology as a KR formalism for a Semantic Web use case. Previous work on probabilistic ontologies has investigated use cases such as fraud detection, threat detection, and breast cancer detection in government, military and healthcare domains but not in Semantic Web. Uncertainty also manifests in various forms and all of them are often not present in single use case. We have chosen the use case for achieving belief fusion under uncertainty to investigate how probabilistic ontology copes with all three expectations for a semantic web KR formalism; expressiveness, tractability and semantic interoperability. Proposed probabilistic ontology based system automates the background verification part of human recruiting process. This use case is a representative case for belief fusion and asserts Bayesian networks as belief fusion operator. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Cyber-Physical Systems 152 6.6 Case Study: Big Data Driven Vehicular Cyber-Physical Systems Design 154 6.7 Conclusion 164 Acknowledgments 164 References 165 Big data as a phase have been among the biggest trends of the four years, giving rise to an upsurge of research and development, as well as industry and government applications. Data are deemed a powerful and useful raw material that can impact multidisciplinary research endeavors as well as government, industry, and business performance. Everyone is talking about big data, and it is believed that science, business, industry, government, society, and so forth will undergo a thorough change with the influence of big data [1]. In fact, we now live in the era of big data as huge and complex data sets, which are being produced and collected for diverse purposes through all kinds of technologies or approaches including mobile devices, remote sensing technologies, software logs, wireless sensor networks, and social media. The big data sets tend to be more unstructured, distributed, and complex than ever before [2]. Thus, big data are defined as huge amount of data that require new technologies and architectures so that it becomes possible to extract value from them by capturing and analysis process. Due to such large size of data, it becomes very difficult to perform effective analysis using the existing traditional techniques. Big data due to their various properties like volume, velocity, variety, variability, value, and complexity put forward many challenges [3]. Under the great increase in global data, the term big data is constantly used to describe huge data sets. Compared with traditional data sets, big data typically compose of masses of unstructured data, sensor data, and stream data that need more real-time processing. Big data are characterized by three aspects: (1) data are numerous, (2) data cannot be categorized into regular relational databases, and (3) data are generated, captured, and processed rapidly. Moreover, big data are transforming health care, transportation, aerospace, science, engineering, finance, business, and eventually, the society [4]. In addition, big data also give rise to new opportunities for discovering new values, make us gain an in-depth understanding of the hidden values, and also bring new challenges, for example, how to effectively specify, model, capture, transfer, organize, and manage such data sets [5]. Big data aim to handle high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety data to extract intended data value and ensure high veracity of original data and obtained information that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of data and information processing for enhanced insight, decision making, and process control; all of these demand new data models and new infrastructure services and tools that allow also obtaining from a variety of sources and delivering data in a variety of forms to different data and information consumers and devices [6]. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - We discuss in this paper, semantic web methodologies, best practices and recommendations beyond the IERC Cluster Semantic Interoperability Best Practices and Recommendations (IERC AC4). The semantic web community designed best practices and methodologies which are unknown from the IoT community. In this paper, we synthesize and highlight the most relevant work regarding ontology methodologies, engineering, best practices and tools that could be applied to Internet of Things (IoT). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work aiming at bridging such methodologies to the IoT community and go beyond the IERC AC4 cluster. This research is being applied to three uses cases: (1) the M3 framework assisting IoT developers in designing interoperable ontology-based IoT applications, (2) the FIESTA-IoT EU project encouraging semantic interoperability within IoT, and (3) a collaborative publication of legacy ontologies. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - The Aquaculture industry, which comprises mainly of SME companies, represents a significant source of protein for people. From an IT perspective, aquaculture is characterized high volumes of heterogeneous data, and also lack of interoperability intra and inter-organisations. Each organization uses different data representations, using its native languages and legacy classification systems to manage and organize information. The lack of semantic interoperability that exists can be minimized, if innovative semantic techniques for representing, indexing and searching sources of non-structured information are applied. The work presented here, describes the achievements under AQUASMART EU project, which aims to accelerate innovation in Europe's aquaculture through technology transfer for the deployment of an open data solution through multilingual data collection and analytics solutions and services, turning the large volumes of heterogeneous aquaculture data that is distributed across the value chain, into an open cloud of semantically interoperable data assets and knowledge. Results achieved so far do not address the final conclusions of the project but form the basis for the formalization of the AQUASMART semantic referential. © © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Information Sharing (IS) is essential for organizations to obtain information in a cost-effective way. If the existing information is not shared among the organizations that hold it, the alternative is to develop the necessary capabilities to acquire, store, process and manage it, which will lead to duplicated costs, especially unwanted if governmental organizations are concerned. The European Commission has elected IS among public administrations as a priority, has launched several IS initiatives, such as the EUCISE2020 project within the roadmap for developing the maritime Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), and has defined the levels of interoperability essential for IS, which entail Semantic Interoperability (SI). An open question is how can IS performance be managed? Specifically, how can IS as-is, and to-be states and targets be defined, and how can organizations progress be monitored and controlled? In this paper, we propose 11 indicators for assessing SI that contribute to answering these questions. They have been demonstrated and evaluated with the data collected through a questionnaire, based on the CISE information model proposed during the CoopP project, which was answered by five public authorities that require maritime surveillance information and are committed to share information with each other. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Ontology mapping is a task aiming to align semantic resources in order to foster the re-use of information and to enable the knowledge and data expressed in the matched ontologies to interoperate. When ontology mapping algorithms are applied in practice, a manual refinement is furtherly necessary for validating the correctness of the resulted resource, especially, as it happens in real-world cases, when a gold standard cannot be exploited for assessing the generated mappings. In this paper, we present a suggestion-based mapping system, integrated as a component of a knowledge management platform, implementing an information retrieval-based (IR-based) approach for generating and validating, by experts, mappings between ontologies. The proposed platform has been evaluated quantitatively (i.e. effectiveness of suggestions, reduction of the user effort, etc.) and qualitatively (i.e. usability) on two use cases: Organic. Lingua and PRESTO, respectively an EU-funded and regional-funded projects. The results demonstrated the effectiveness and usability of the proposed platform in a real-world environment. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Electronic service, or e-service, is a key concept in today’s e-Government development. The availability and quality of electronic services are important indicators of e-Government maturity. However, we argue that our understanding of the concept e-service is poor and we show that the ambiguity surrounding the concept creates problems when building ontologies and thus makes it difficult to achieve better interoperability between systems. We thus propose a model for e-services building on a framework for categorizing services using some basic terms. In this way we can describe and model various types of communication between citizens and public agencies based on a consistent set of elementary categories. Our model also draws on EU’s proposed Core Public Service Vocabulary (CPSV). The paper is conceptual and is mainly based on a literature review. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.

AB  - Introduction: This article is part of the Focus Theme of Methods of Information in Medicine on “Managing Interoperability and Complexity in Health Systems”.Background: Primary care data is the single richest source of routine health care data. However its use, both in research and clinical work, often requires data from multiple clinical sites, clinical trials databases and registries. Data integration and interoperability are therefore of utmost importance.Objectives: TRANSFoRm’s general approach relies on a unified interoperability framework described in a previous paper. We devel - oped a core ontology for an interoperability framework based on data mediation. This article presents how such an ontology, the Clinical Data Integration Model (CDIM), can be designed to support, in conjunction with appropriate terminologies, biomedical data federation within TRANSFoRm, an EU FP7 project that aims to develop the digital infrastructure for a learning healthcare system in European Primary Care.Methods: TRANSFoRm utilizes a unified structural/terminological interoperability frame work, based on the local-as-view media - tion paradigm. Such an approach mandates the global information model to describe the domain of interest independently of the data sources to be explored. Following a requirement analysis process, no ontology focusing on primary care research was identified and, thus we designed a realist ontology based on Basic Formal Ontology to support our framework in collaboration with various terminologies used in primary care.Results: The resulting ontology has 549 classes and 82 object properties and is used to support data integration for TRANSFoRm’s use cases. Concepts identified by researchers were successfully expressed in queries using CDIM and pertinent terminologies. As an example, we illustrate how, in TRANSFoRm, the Query Formulation Workbench can cap - ture eligibility criteria in a computable rep - resentation, which is based on CDIM.Conclusion: A unified mediation approach to semantic interoperability provides a flexible and extensible framework for all types of interaction between health record systems and research systems. CDIM, as core ontology of such an approach, enables simplicity and consistency of design across the heterogeneous software landscape and can support the specific needs of EHR-driven phenotyping research using primary care data. © Schattauer 2015.

AB  - Public information regarding immovable property is recorded in national registries, including cadastre and land registry, building and dwelling (or address) registry, and property tax registry. An efficient land administration system is supposed to orchestrate these registries for crossborder and cross-sector land administration services. The recent developments in Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Data approach provide an efficient and flexible solution for web based integration of datasets recorded in these registries. The mentioned registries were specified according to different data models and standards which lead to interoperability problems. The concerned public organisations therefore need a common data model that clearly identifies the recording units of these registries and their core attributes, as well as relationships between them. The present research responds to this requirement by developing a common vocabulary, a Core Immovable Property Vocabulary, as an extension to the e-Government Core Vocabularies (version 1.0) issued recently by the European Commission (EC). The Core Immovable Property Vocabulary is developed by simplifying and capturing the minimal characteristics of complex domain standards and data specifications, thereby enabling a plain representation of immovable property units and their core attributes that are needed for land administration processes. It thus allows for the publication of land administration data sets within the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and renders the integration of land administration datasets with other registries such as address and civil registries encoded according to the e- Government Core Vocabularies. The vocabulary is the result of an individual research effort, carried out by the authors of the present article, and has recently been hosted by the EC ISA (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administration) Joinup platform as a semantic asset (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/cipv/description). The main contribution is the introduction of the Linked Data approach to the land administration domain which may make land administration data sets more accessible via the Web. © 2015 Survey Review Ltd.

AB  - The "DIRECTIVE 2010/31/EU" on the energy performance of buildings with the objective that new developments are "nearly zero energy buildings" until 2020, the potential of energy neutral neighborhood developments as well as the requests for sustainable design and evaluation according to established sustainability certification systems, have introduced a more holistic and integrated design approach. This approach requires intensive collaborative work of many different discipline experts and requires cross domain model interoperability. To support the collaborative working in the European Research Project Collaborative Holistic Design Laboratory and Methodology for energy-efficient Embedded Buildings (eeEmbedded 10/2013-09/2017) aVirtual Design Laboratory (VDL) will be developed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The EU funded collaborative research project STREAMER aims on Energy-efficient Buildings (EeB), focusing on mixed-use healthcare districts. Besides innovations in EeB technology, special emphasis is laid on improving methodologies and tools used in the design process of new or retrofitted hospital buildings. STREAMER follows a model-based, holistic approach by integrating design data on both building and district level.Advanced ICT methods like Semantic Web, Ontologies, Parametric Modelling or Knowledge Based Systems, will be reviewed, adapted, and improved to use them during the energy-efficient-buildings design process. The project not only aims on developing theoretical concepts, but also on practical case studies: based on already existing software, a number of interoperable software tools shall be developed and evaluated in four demonstration projects. The paper describes the system architecture and provides a functional spectrum of the design tools, focusing on interoperability issues. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The EU-funded eNanoMapper project proposes a computational infrastructure for toxicological data management of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) based on open standards, ontologies and an interoperable design to enable a more effective, integrated approach to European research in nanotechnology. eNanoMapper's goal is to support the collaborative safety assessment for ENMs by creating a modular, extensible infrastructure for transparent data sharing, data analysis, and the creation of computational toxicology models for ENMs. The eNanoMapper database solution builds on previous experience of the consortium partners in supporting diverse data through flexible data storage, semantic web technologies, open source components and web services. A number of opportunities and challenges exist in nanomaterials representation and integration of ENM information, originating from diverse systems. A short summary, highlighting the pros and cons of the existing integration approaches and data models is presented. We demonstrate the approach of adopting an ontology-supported data model, describing the materials and measurements. The data sources supported include diverse formats (ISA-Tab, OECD Harmonized Templates, custom spreadsheet templates, various databases provided by consortia members). Besides retaining the data provenance, the focus on measurements provides insights into how to reuse the chemical structure database tools for nanomaterials characterization and safety. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Natural history museums (NHMs) form a rich source of knowledge about Earth's biodiversity and natural history. However, an impressive abundance of high-quality scientific content available in NHMs around Europe remains largely unexploited due to a number of barriers, such as the lack of interconnection and interoperability between the management systems used by museums, the lack of centralized access through a European point of reference such as Europeana and the inadequacy of the current metadata and content organization. The Natural Europe project offers a coordinated solution at European level that aims to overcome those barriers. In this article, we present the architecture, deployment and evaluation of the Natural Europe infrastructure allowing the curators to publish, semantically describe and manage the museums' cultural heritage objects, as well as disseminate them to Europeana.eu and BioCASE/GBIF. Additionally, we discuss the methodology followed for the transition of the infrastructure to the Semantic Web and the publishing of NHMs' cultural heritage metadata as Linked Data, supporting the Europeana Data Model. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Interoperability of e-government systems is suggested to increase transparency, efficiency, effectiveness, and customer service in the public sector. Generic data models are often seen as a way for achieving especially semantic interoperability. To assess how the contemporary data models support semantic egovernment interoperability, we reviewed literature on data models suggested for the public sector in light of four features: standard modelling language, entityrelationship modelling, vocabulary for data exchange and methodology. The review contributes previous research by introducing a four-feature framework for assessing capability of e-government data models to enhance interoperability and by providing an up-To-date review of the generic data models for this purpose. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The sharing and reuse of interoperability solutions is a key enabler towards overcoming interoperability barriers of any type (i.e. legal, organisational, semantic or technical) in cross-border digital public services. In order to facilitate the access of public administrations in Europe to reusable interoperability solutions, the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations Programme of the European Commission (ISA Programme) has been running for the last 3 years an action on syndicating content from different repositories and making it available through a single point of access. Initially, the efforts focused on semantic interoperability solutions, but they are now being expanded to cover legal, organisation and technical ones as well. This complete collection of interrelated interoperability solutions coming from Member States, EU Institutions and standardisation organisations will form the so-called European Federated Interoperability Repository (EFIR). In this paper we present inception, the underlying metadata model and the architecture, as well as the first operational pilot of EFIR. EFIR will be based on a federated architecture, where the description metadata of disparate collections of interoperability solutions will be shared on Joinup. All description metadata will conform to the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) Application Profile for Joinup, which will serve as a common vocabulary guaranteeing the interoperability of the collected metadata. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - The paper presents a case study which highlights interoperable aspects of geographic information in a local government within the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE). Special emphasis of data and language heterogeneity specifically is given to the integration of community data within the higher infrastructure levels. The existing 34 data themes needed for environmental applications are referenced in Annexes I, II and III of the INSPIRE directive. The framework for the implementation is given by key components specified through technical implementing rules. The rules enable sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organizations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across the European Union. For selected municipal data themes, the relation with the implementing rules will be investigated. The considerations are guided by the objectives of searchability, usability, reusability, composability and interoperability of digital data. Based on the current situation in the context of geographic information, data transformation and the usage of standards of the semantic web and ontologies to solve heterogeneity problems in data management are discussed. Cases of interoperability at the semantic, syntactic, and organisational level as well as results of data transformation and cartographic enhancement of local government data within the European spatial data infrastructure will be illustrated in the paper. In that way, we demonstrate how extensive knowledge which is already available for local government data can be used at the European level. © SGEM2014.

AB  - Presently, a very large number of public and private data sets are available around the local governments. In most cases, they are not semantically interoperable and a huge human effort is needed to create integrated ontologies and knowledge base for smart city. Smart City ontology is not yet standardized, and a lot of research work is needed to identify models that can easily support the data reconciliation, the management of the complexity and reasoning. In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a big volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to smart-city ontology and stored into an RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries to provide new services to the users. The paper presents the process adopted to produce the ontology and the knowledge base and the mechanisms adopted for the verification, reconciliation and validation. Some examples about the possible usage of the coherent knowledge base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-Store and related services. The article also presented the work performed about reconciliation algorithms and their comparative assessment and selection. © 2014 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.

AB  - Antibiotics resistance poses a significant problem in today's hospital care. Although large amounts of resistance data are gathered locally, they can-not be compared globally due to format and access diversity.We present an ontology-based integration approach serving an EU project in making antibiotics resistance data semantically and geographically interopera-ble. We particularly focus on EU-wide clinical data integration for real-time an-tibiotic resistance surveillance. The data semantics is formalized by multiple layers of terminology-bound description logic ontologies. Local database-to-RDF (D2R) converters, normalizers and data wrapper ontologies render hospi-tal data accessible to SPARQL queries, which populate a mediator layer. This semiformal data is then integrated and rendered comparable via formal OWL domain ontologies and rule-driven reasoning applications. The presented inte-gration layer enables clinical data miners to query over multiple hospitals which behave like one homogeneous 'virtual clinical information system'. We show how cross-site querying can be achieved across borders, languages and different data models. Aside the drawbacks, we elaborate on the unique advantages over comparable previous efforts, i.e. tackling real-time data access and scalability.

AB  - Long term preservation of digital information, including machine generated large data sets, is a growing necessity in many domains. A key challenge to this need is the creation of vendor-neutral storage containers that can be interpreted over time. We describe SIRF, the Self-contained Information Retention Format, which is being developed by the Storage Networking Industry Association (SNIA) to support this challenge. We define the SIRF components, its metadata, categories and elements, along with some security guidelines. SIRF metadata includes the semantic information as well as schema and ontological information needed to preserve the physical integrity and logical meaning of preservation objects. We also describe how the SIRF logical format is serialized for storage containers in the cloud and for tape based containers. Aspects of SIRF serialization for the cloud are being experimented with OpenStack Swift object storage in the ForgetIT EU project.

AB  - The World Wide Web and related technologies are playing an increasing role in the field of Integrated Environmental Modelling (IEM). Model integration software frameworks are more and more becoming web-enabled. The technologies and standards of the Web are used to access and run simulation models remotely (known as the Web of models) and are considered for enabling interoperability across model integration frameworks. Furthermore there is a growing number of local and global initiatives to provide open access to environmental data (Web of data) that can potentially be used as input for the scientific models. The availability of descriptive information of sufficient quality about the scientific models and datasets that is semantically aligned is a necessity for efforts like the Web of models and the Web of data, and for their integration. The EU FP7 project LIAISE - Linking Impact Assessment Instruments to Sustainability Expertise - is collecting and providing meta-descriptions on good practices, experts, scientific models and guidelines in its shared Impact Assessment toolbox called the LIAISE KIT. An international community of experts has been formed that provides and maintains these meta-descriptions. This knowledge base however is currently primarily targeted at a human audience and only accessible from a website. To ensure future usage initial steps are being taken in two small sub-projects of LIAISE to publish the content as part of the semantic web, and to examine the use of ontology and Natural Language Processing for metadata extraction. This has as research goal the (semi-)automated creation of relevant metadata from existing unstructured text sources such as scientific publications and websites. Preliminary results of these two sub-projects are described in this paper. Although showing promise some further research is still required, including a proof of concept implementation.

AB  - Linked Open Data (LOD) enable the semantic interoperability of Public Administration (PA) information. Moreover, they allow citizens to reuse public information for creating new services and applications. Although there are many methodologies and guidelines to produce and publish LOD, the PAs still hardly understand and exploit LOD to improve their activities. In this paper we show the use of a set of best practices to support an Italian PA in producing LOD. We show the case of LOD production from existing open datasets related to public services. Together with the production of LOD we present the definition of a reference ontology, the Public Service Ontology, integrated with the datasets. During the application, we highlight and discuss some critical points we found in methodologies and technologies described in the literature, and we identify some potential improvements.

AB  - In order to enable interoperability between ontology-based systems, ontology matching techniques have been proposed. However, when the generated mappings suffer from logical flaws, their usefulness may be diminished. In this paper we present an approximate method to detect and correct violations to the so-called conservativity principle where novel subsumption entailments between named concepts in one of the input ontologies are considered as unwanted. We show that this is indeed the case in our application domain based on the EU Optique project. Additionally, our extensive evaluation conducted with both the Optique use case and the data sets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI) suggests that our method is both useful and feasible in practice. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - The analysis of global R&D information has become an important factor in making R&D investment strategies and global cooperation with the increased competition in the global market. The R&D analysis in Korea is based on the National Science and Technology Information Service (NTIS). However, it is limited to domestic information and the need to widen the analysis to the global market has risen recently. LOD (Linked Open Data) Cloud service, which is based on the openness and the connection of data, is being expanded recently as is the use of Mashup services through the connection with data from other institutes. In this paper, we will analyze the Linked data structure of CORDIS (Community Research and Development Information Service), which is the R&D information service adopted by the EU, and then suggest a case for utilizing the linked data format and design model for implementing the semantic web to effectively analyze the global national R&D trends by using a case where the RDF Triple data has been semantically mashed up from NTIS and NDSL (National Discovery for Science Leaders). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In e-government domain, an efficient semantic interoperability of services is a big challenge. Thus, for modelling semantically the public services, we have adopted semantic web services (SWS) technology. However, this technology allows only semantic description of services without giving a cognitive semantic representation of them. It allows modelling the relationships between services with their different situations through conceptual structures (CSs). In this paper, we develop an approach for modelling efficiently the public services based on SWS and CSs technologies. For this purpose, we extend OWL-S ontology with an e-government knowledge represented through a set of ontologies. Besides OWL-S ontology, we use the conceptual graphs theory as implemented in AminePlatform for structuring and organising the cognitive knowledge about services. Thus, for our application domain, that is, 'e-customs', we extend this platform to support simultaneous use of multiple domain-specific ontologies. Our approach enables as well enhancing service discovery and composition. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Extracting scientifically accurate terminology from an EU public health regulation is part of the knowledge engineering work at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). ECDC operates information systems at the crossroads of many areas-posing a challenge for transparency and consistency. Semantic interoperability is based on the Terminology Server (TS). TS value sets (structured vocabularies) describe shared domains as 'diseases', 'organisms', 'public health terms', 'geo-entities' 'organizations' and 'administrative terms' and others. We extracted information from the relevant EC Implementing Decision on case definitions for reporting communicable diseases, listing 53 notifiable infectious diseases, containing clinical, diagnostic, laboratory and epidemiological criteria. We performed a consistency check; a simplification-abstraction; we represented lab criteria in triplets: as 'y' procedural result /of 'x' organism-substance/on 'z' specimen and identified negations. The resulting new case definition value set represents the various formalized criteria, meanwhile the existing disease value set has been extended, new signs and symptoms were added. New organisms enriched the organism value set. Other new categories have been added to the public health value set, as transmission modes; substances; specimens and procedures. We identified problem areas, as (a) some classification error(s); (b) inconsistent granularity of conditions; (c) seemingly nonsense criteria, medical trivialities; (d) possible logical errors, (e) seemingly factual errors that might be phrasing errors. We think our hypothesis regarding room for possible improvements is valid: there are some open issues and a further improved legal text might lead to more precise epidemiologic data collection. It has to be noted that formal representation for automatic classification of cases was out of scope, such a task would require other formalism, as e.g. those used by rule-based decision support systems.

AB  - Background. The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European Union to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme "Horizon 2020" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights. We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information. Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation. © Willi Egloff et al.

AB  - The advancement of information and communications technology and web services offers an opportunity for e-government service integration, which can help improve the availability and quality of services offered. However, few of the potential service integration applications have been adopted by governments to increase the accessibility of and satisfaction with government services and information for citizens. Recently, the 'life event' concept was introduced as the core element of integrating complexity of service delivery to improve the efficiency and reusability of e-government services, web-based information management systems. In addition, a semantic web-based ontology is considered to be the most powerful conceptual approach for dealing with challenges associated with developing seamless systems in distributed environments. Among these challenges are interoperability, which can be loosely defined as the technical capability for interoperation. Despite the conceptual emergence of semantic web-based ontology for life events, the question remains of what methodology to use when designing a semantic web-based ontology for life events. This paper proposes a semantic web-based ontology model for life events for e-government service integration created using a methodology that implements the model using the ontology modelling tool Protégé and evaluates the model using Pellet Reasoner and the SPARQL query language. In addition, this model is illustrated by two examples, the Saudi Arabia King Abdullah Scholarship and Hafiz, to show the advantages of integrated systems compared with standalone systems. These examples show that the new model can effectively support the integration of standalone e-government services automatically so that citizens do not need to manually execute individual services. This can significantly improve the accessibility of e-government services and citizen's satisfaction. © 2014-IOS Press.

AB  - We report on the results of the application of a method and tool for ontology construction in the research information domain, held in the context of an open data initiative of Flanders. The method emphasizes the use of natural language descriptions of concepts next to formal descriptions, and uses - for the formal definitions - a fact-oriented formalism grounded in natural language. In this experiment, a group of 36 participants were divided into different groups to build ontologies to establish semantic interoperability between autonomously developed research information systems and to annotate the data of an existing system provided by a public administration. User satisfaction of the tool was measured with the Post-Study System Usability uestionnaire. The result of that survey was that the participants were generally pleased with the platform, with its usefulness scoring best. As for the developed ontologies, their use was demonstrated by the applications developed by the participants. The experiment showed that having a formalism grounded in natural language leverages the ontology construction process for the stakeholders. The experiment also shows that a method needs to take into account the collaborative building of workflows within ontology projects, as not all ontology-engineering projects are alike. © 2014 Universidad de Talca-Chile.

AB  - Purpose: In e-government domain, an efficient semantic interoperability of services is a big challenge. In this context, semantic technologies play a fundamental role in numerous e-government programs. Indeed, these technologies enable enriching the public service description provided by different public administrations with additional semantic information, which allows automatic services processing and information exchange between involved members in comprehensive and interpretable manner, thus facilitating service integration and cooperation. The most frequently used technologies in this area are semantic web services (SWS) technology and ontology. Thus, for modelling efficiently public services, the authors have exploring, studying and analyzing some of e-government researches and projects that applied semantic technologies. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors address how semantic technologies transform the e-government domain through exploring and studying the use of SWS and ontology in numerous researches and projects applying these technologies in this area. Then, the authors have compared them through a set of criteria defined according to e-government requirements such as the SWS modelling approach for describing semantically public services, ontologies for representing governmental specific features (e.g. regulation and organizational structures) and developed portal for supporting user's perspectives. Based on this study, the authors have identified the appropriate standards, frameworks, and models for developing the framework. Findings: The authors have developed a framework for public services which enhances existing approaches with additional aspects. Thus, the approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of services. This semantic is developed in form of a Sit/Ctx ontology developed based on CSs model represented through conceptual graphs theory. The authors have used this model besides OWL-S, improving thus the level of automation of discovery and composition process of public services, which become more efficient with taken into consideration their interrelations and situations. Originality/value: The approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of public services, providing thus the end-users (people and enterprises) a better orientation in discovery process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Current research in oncology, require the involvement of several institutions participating in clinical trials. Heterogeneities of data formats and models require advanced methods to achieve semantic interoperability and provide sustainable solutions. In this field, the EU funded INTEGRATE project aims to develop the basic knowledge to allow data sharing of data from post-genomic clinical trials on breast cancer. In this paper, we describe the procedure implemented in this project and the required binding between relevant terminologies such as SNOMED CT and an HL7 v3 Reference Information Model (RIM)-based data model. After following the HL7 recommendations, we also describe the main issues of this process and the proposed solution, such as concept overlapping and coverage of the domain terminology. Despite the fact that the data from this domain presents a high level of heterogeneity, the methods and solutions introduced in this paper have been successfully applied within the INTEGRATE project context. Results suggest that the level of semantic interoperability required to manage patient data in modern clinical trials on breast cancer can be achieved with the proposed methodology. © 2013 IEEE.

The subject is presented as an open issue and taking into account the circumstances of the exchanges. Electronic exchanges in European Union social security are used as a case study. Semantic level of these exchanges seems to be the weakness and the use of controlled vocabularies is proposed as possible solution. The creation and maintenance of metadata sets are finally considered as a compromise solution. The article proposes a solution for the current semantic problems in electronic exchanges of social security information. The solution could be useful for social security institutions all over the world. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Innovations in healthcare delivery and Pharma require re-examination of process models at the foundation of our knowledge discovery and clinical practice. Despite real-time availability of 'big data' from ubiquitous sensors, mobile devices, 3D printing of drugs, and a mind shift in data ownership, data integration still remains one of the core challenges to innovation. Increasingly persistent, semantic data integration is gaining recognition for its dynamic data model and formalisms which make it possible to infer from and reason over interconnected contextualized data, creating actionable knowledge faster and at lower cost. While such technical advances underpin the successful strategies to drive positive patient outcomes or accelerate drug design, there are equally profound social changes towards the willingness of patients to share their own data - opening doors to new patient-centric, precision-medicine healthcare models. Adding astronomically rising costs in research and healthcare, we have arrived at a critical turning point where it is now well within our reach to change how drugs are developed, how trials are performed and how patients are treated - and we can do this with huge benefits for otherwise unsustainable industries. Examples show that not only is this possible today, but that such approaches already have traction; (i) in Pharma for assessing impact of excipient on drug stability and efficacy; for pre-clinical toxicity assessment and integral systems views on drug safety, (ii) in Government at the FDA's cross species biomarker initiative to reduce animal testing and (iii) in Health Care for organ transplant rejection assessment and COPD. Using comparative effectiveness and side effect analyses to base treatments on solid prognoses and therapy decision support, we can and must change discovery and healthcare into a data driven and patient centric paradigm. The socio-economic benefits of such a change will be enormous. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Searching, browsing and analyzing web contents is today a challenging problem when compared to early Internet ages. This is due to the fact that web content is multimedial, social and dynamic. Moreover, concepts referred by videos, news, comments, posts, are implicitly linked by the fact that people on the Web talks about something, somewhere at some time and these connections may change as the perception of users on the Web changes over time. We define a model for the integration of the heterogeneous and dynamic data coming from different knowledge sources (broadcasters' archives, online newspapers, blogs, web encyclopedias, social media platforms, social networks, etc.). We use a knowledge graph to model all the heterogenous aspects of the information in an homogeneous way. Through a case study on social TV, we provide a non trivial cross-domain analysis scenario on real data gathered from YouTube and Twitter, and related to an Italian TV talk show on politics, broadcasted by RAI, the Italian public-service broadcasting organization.

AB  - The introduction of -omic information within current clinical treatment is one of the main challenges to transfer the huge amount of genomic-based results. The number of potential translational clinical trials is therefore experiencing a dramatic increase, with the corresponding increment on patient variability. Such scenario requires a larger population to recruit a minimum set of patients that may involve multi-centric trials, with associated challenges on heterogeneous data integration. To ensure sustainability on clinical trial management, semantic interoperability is one of the main goals addressed by international initiatives such as the EU funded INTEGRATE project: "Driving Excellence in Integrative Cancer Research". This paper describes the approach adopted within an international research initiative, providing a homogeneous platform to manage clinical information from patients on breast cancer clinical trials. Following the project "leitmotif" of reusing standards supported by a large community, we have developed a solution providing a common data model (i.e. HL7 RIM-based), a biomedical domain vocabulary (i.e. SNOMED) as core dataset and resources from the semantic web community adapted for the biomedical domain. After one year and a half of collaboration, the INTEGRATE consortium has been able to develop a solution providing the reasoning capabilities required to solve clinical trial patient recruitment. The next challenge will be to extend the current solution to support a cohort selection tool allowing prospective analysis and predictive modeling.

AB  - The main purpose of the paper is to present a case study of the use of semantic technologies within e- Government context. We aim to describe the semantic layer that was designed in the scope of the SPOCS project to enable the validation of documents in the scope of cross border procedures. The SPOCS project (Simple Procedures Online for Cross- Border Services)1 focuses in particular on the transfer of documents to European administrations in the scope of procedures to deliver services across borders. One of the problems that arise is the heterogeneity of documents between countries even they have the same role. With the increase of cross border activities encouraged by the service directive in particular, electronic procedures are more important than ever. The project has therefore set up an infrastructure including the transfer of documents in a metadata container and the validation of documents. Cross-border service pilots have been implemented to show the added value of the SPOCS infrastructure. To overcome the problem of semantic equivalence of documents, the European Commission has encouraged the implementation of a semantic layer to support the interoperability between administrative systems and the reuse of resources across government bodies. In the scope of the SPOCS project, we have implemented a set of pilots to illustrate the added value of implementing a semantic interoperability layer and developing common models and vocabularies. Common ontologies have been designed to describe documents, equivalences, and procedures. Specific access mechanisms have been implemented to automatically verify the status of European companies. Finally, semantic rules have been created to determine the procedure that needs to be used in order to provide a cross border service. SPOCS resources are posted to the JoinUp portal2. © The Authors, 2013.

AB  - With the emergence of social media, data available for market analytics has grown significantly, especially in the context of product lifecycle value analysis. Existing architecture frameworks do not support knowledge management, required to process massive amount of market data, or 'big data'. In order to perform product lifecycle value analysis, product managers need to access, in a seamless manner, data from several domains from systems within the organization and from external sources such as social media, government and industry sites, to name a few. The structured and integrated data must then be transformed into information, or contextualized data, and ultimately into actionable information or knowledge. To achieve this objective, this paper proposes an innovative approach, the Reference Architecture of an Enterprise Knowledge Infrastructure (RA-EKI) that provides a holistic approach to manage the complete knowledge lifecycle. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.

AB  - Extracting integration rules to handle semantic heterogeneity is one of the main challenges of achieving seamless connectivity between distributed systems. Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR)'s machine and human readability and platform independence make it potentially suitable and interesting to study, as a central semantic hub of different systems. Semantic heterogeneity can be identified by comparing and analyzing vocabularies, fact models and business rules in the hub. Integration rules can then be extracted based on the semantic heterogeneity analysis. This article investigates and evaluates the usage of SBVR in heterogeneous systems integration. It provides a real-life case study and experience report on extracting integration rules based on an analysis of two Norwegian public sector's heterogeneous IT-systems modeled in SBVR.

AB  - Cloud vendor lock-in and interoperability gaps arise (among many reasons) when semantics of resources and services, and of Application Programming Interfaces is not shared. Standards and techniques borrowed from SOA and Semantic Web Services areas might help in gaining shared, machine readable description of Cloud offerings (resources, Services at Platform and Application level, and their API groundings), thus allowing automatic discovery, matchmaking, and thus supporting selection, brokering, interoperability and even composition of Cloud Services among multiple Clouds. The EU funded mOSAIC project (http://www.mosaic-cloud.eu) aims at designing and developing an innovative open-source API and platform that enables applications to be Cloud providers' neutral and to negotiate Cloud services as requested by their users. In this context, using the mOSAIC Cloud ontology and Semantic Engine, cloud applications' developers will be able to specify their services and resources requirements independently from Cloud providers' specific solutions. In order to update and maintain the platform and the mOSAIC API, the mOSAIC Semantic Discovery Service will, on the other hand, discover Cloud providers' functionalities and resources, and will compare and align to the mOSAIC API, thus supporting agnostic and interoperable access to Cloud providers' offers. © 2013 The Authors.

AB  - Current post-genomic clinical trials in cancer involve the collaboration of several institutions. Multi-centric retrospective analysis requires advanced methods to ensure semantic interoperability. In this scenario, the objective of the EU funded INTEGRATE project, is to provide an infrastructure to share knowledge and data in post-genomic breast cancer clinical trials. This paper presents the process carried out in this project, to bind domain terminologies in the area, such as SNOMED CT, with the HL7 v3 Reference Information Model (RIM). The proposed terminology binding follow the HL7 recommendations, but should also consider important issues such as overlapping concepts and domain terminology coverage. Although there are limitations due to the large heterogeneity of the data in the area, the proposed process has been successfully applied within the context of the INTEGRATE project. An improvement in semantic interoperability of patient data from modern breast cancer clinical trials, aims to enhance the clinical practice in oncology. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.

AB  - Breast cancer clinical trial researchers have to handle heterogeneous data coming from different data sources, overloading biomedical researchers when they need to query data for retrospective analysis. This paper presents the Common Data Model (CDM) proposed within the INTEGRATE EU project to homogenize data coming from different clinical partners. This CDM is based on the Reference Information Model (RIM) from the Health Level 7 (HL7) version 3. Semantic capabilities through an SPARQL endpoint were also required to ensure the sustainability of the platform. For the SPARQL endpoint implementation, a comparison has been carried out between a Relational SQL database + D2R and a RDF database. The results show that the first option can store all clinical data received from institutions participating in the project with a better performance. It has been also evaluated by the EU Commission within a patient recruitment demonstrator. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.

AB  - With greater reliance on coalitions for military force deployment, there is a need for organizational collaboration and system interoperability. Interoperability requires full exchange of data, information (contextualized data) and knowledge (actionable information), which ensures that coalition's members will fully collaborate in synchronizing their logistics plans and processes at all echelons. Existing architecture frameworks, such as NATO's Architecture Framework (NAF) and The Open Group architecture Framework (TOGAF), do not support knowledge management, required to process massive amount of data. In order to perform collaborative logistics planning, logisticians and commanders need to access, in a seamless manner, data and information from several domains from systems within the coalition and from external sources such as social media, government and supplier sites, to name a few. The integrated and structured data must then be transformed into information, or contextualized data, and ultimately into actionable information or knowledge. This paper proposes an innovative approach, the Reference Architecture of an Enterprise Knowledge Infrastructure (RA-EKI) that provides a holistic and integrative approach to manage the complete unstructured data to knowledge lifecycle applicable to military logistics planning. © 2013 Military University of Technology.

AB  - Different public institutions such as General Directorate of Transportation, Provincial Public Administration, and municipalities in Turkey have produced transportation data sets. Private initiatives have developed navigation and network management applications using transportation geo-data sets. However, transportation geo-data sets are at different quality and content and these data does not meet transportation application needs. The first step is to create an interoperable transportation geo-data model. This theme has a harmonized geo-data model for Highway-Airway-Railway-Waterway. In this study, due to specific application needs and full range capabilities of transportation management, feature types in this theme were designed with model-driven approach to provide semantic geo-data interoperability. Second part of this study is to develop web based GIS applications and services to manage transportation geo-data sets interoperable. These data sets have been used in various thematic application areas with OGC web services. In this way, transportation geo-data sets as open data were used in various thematic application area and working environment. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.

AB  - In recent years, antimalware applications represented one of the most important research topics in the area of network security threat. In addition, malware have become a growing important problem for governments and commercial organizations. The key point of the research on the network security is to judge and validate the similarity metrics among the malicious software. Indeed, most computer network issues are also caused by malware. As a consequence, one enhanced system to analyze the behavior of malwares is needed to try to predict the malicious actions and to minimize the computer damages caused by the malware. However, the conventional data analysis tools lack the ability to deal with the computer safety because the environments malwares operating are with high levels of imprecision and vagueness. For this reason, we have developed Taiwan Malware Analysis Net (TWMAN) to improve the accuracy of malware behavioral analysis. This chapter tries to explorer and deal with these computer security and safety issues by integrating the semantic technologies and computational intelligence methods, such as the fuzzy ontologies and fuzzy markup language (FML). With the proposed approach, the malware identification has achieved a good performance according to the experimental results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - There are several data silos containing information about business entities and people but are not semantically connected. If in integration process of data sources trust management is also employed than we can expect much higher success rate in relations discovery among entities. Majority of current mash-up approaches that deal with integration of information from several data sources omit or don't fully address the aspect of trust. In this paper we discuss semantic integration of personal and business information from various data sources coupled with trust layer. The resulting system has higher and more defined solidity while trust for single entity and also for data source is defined. The case study presented in the paper focuses on integration of personal information from data sources mainly maintained by government authorities who have higher trustability than information from social networks, but we also include other less trusted sources. The developed SocioLeaks system allows users traversal and further relation discovery in a graph based manner. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is hard to automatically find a semantically meaningful web service composition over a huge collection of web services available on the web. However, recent results in semantic web service research and technology could be effectively used within some specific domains. E-government is one of the sectors that need horizontal integration. Therefore, semantic web services and their composition become necessary and applicable in this domain. The paper proposes a semantic method of automatic composition of e-government services. It uses domain ontologies presented in OWL, semantic web services described in SAWSDL, quality of service (QoS) characteristics, ontology reasoning and AI planner in order to automatically provide service plans that could be presented in some service execution language. The approach is motivated by a case study from the domain of the Estonian state information systems. © 2013 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - The divergent interpretations of data, the lack of common metadata and the absence of universal reference data hinder governments from seamless data exchange, information systems integration and the delivery of cross-border public services. To overcome this, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store reusable data models, schemata, taxonomies and codelists. We use the term semantic interoperability asset to refer to these types of resources. These repositories however differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, even bypass the domain it was originally designed for, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets' descriptions hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper introduces the Asset Description Metadata Schema, an initiative of the ISA programme of the European Commission, which aims to deliver a common metamodel for semantic interoperability assets. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Many organizations from the public and the private sector are planning to turn to Cloud Computing services, whose main benefits are flexibility, pay-per-use model and significant cost reduction. However, this new business paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure has certain obstacles, including provider lock-in. When a client chooses a specific Cloud service provider, he also gets the provider's specific protocols, standards and tools, making a potential future migration complex and costly. Cloud Computing is still immature, with no firmly established standards governing all the aspects of its utilization. The migration issue can be overcome by using interoperable Cloud services. In this paper we focus on the platform as a service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing. This model provides a complete computing platform needed to run applications over the Internet. Every PaaS provider (such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce) has specified its custom application programming interfaces (APIs). However, to achieve interoperability we need to develop a standardized set of APIs that constitute an interoperability platform. In this paper, we firstly present the key concepts and relevant related work from the existing literature. Thereafter we propose a novel PaaS API ontology to share a common understanding of the main concepts from providers' APIs. We used a prominent ontology development methodology to determine the domain and scope of our ontology, review similar existing ontologies, define the relevant classes and their hierarchy as well as to define the properties of classes and create their instances. The concepts in our ontology were derived from PaaS resources, remote Cloud functions specified in the API documentation of the most important PaaS solutions, existing Cloud ontologies, Cloud Computing models andstandards for Semantic Web services. The aim of the proposed ontology is the description of PaaS resourcesand their operations. It was built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Protege tool. In the future, we plan to use this ontology to semantically annotate PaaS API operations and create a mechanism to determineand solve interoperability problems among two or more PaaS services provided by different vendors.

AB  - With the increasing complexity of e-Government services, one of the big challenges for public administration is integration of decentralized cross-organizational applications to support an efficient, interactive and seamless e-Government for citizens, businesses and administrations themselves. This paper presents a flexible approach for organizing distributed e-Government services based on Semantic Web. Various public administrative specific domains knowledge were captured, and the semantic index of ontology information was stored for decentralized e-Government services organization through a distributed hast table solution. The architecture was improved by introducing a community ontology to semantic categorize and reorganize e-Government services on the basis of domain ontology, which can support interoperability of cross-organizational e-Government applications and provide a series of future knowledge management on public sector in a scalable environment.

AB  - Since the use of electronic invoicing in business transactions was approved by the EU back in 2002, its application in Europe has grown considerably. However, despite the existence of standards like EDIFACT or UBL, widespread take up of electronic invoicing has been hindered by the enormous heterogeneity of proprietary solutions. In this chapter, the authors present an approach towards addressing the interoperability problem in electronic invoice exchange, based on ontologies and Semantic Web technologies. The authors propose methods and provide usable tools that leverage the knowledge of users of electronic invoicing systems by empowering them to define correspondences between sample electronic invoice data and a formal model of electronic invoicing represented as networked ontologies. The chapter follows a learn-by-example approach where, based on such correspondences, networked ontologies serve as a semantic hub for large-scale transformation of e-invoice data between heterogeneous e-invoicing formats and models. The approach has been evaluated through the development of a reference implementation and its deployment in the pharmaceutical sector. © 2012, IGI Global.

AB  - The heterogeneity of the environment in which data exchange happens is creating many challenges during the execution of digital public services across Europe. Lack of agreement and guidance on the meaning and format of information to be exchanged between Member States are the main stumbling block. Semantic interoperability is jeopardized by different interpretations of the information exchanged between people and applications, thus hampering the effective and efficient creation of new European public services. In an attempt to promote the use of common models and standards, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store semantic data models, taxonomies, codelists and reference data making them openly available for reuse. The term semantic asset has been devised to refer to these types of resources. However, these repositories differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper specifies a generic Exchange API that capitalizes on Linked Data technologies and REST in order to enable the semantic integration of distributed metadata repositories, thus creating a flexible federation which facilitates cross-repository querying and consequently enhances semantic asset reusability.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a semantic web based solution to implement the Interoperability Framework (IF) for Persistent Identifiers (PI) developed within the context of APARSEN EU project. The IF provides a comprehensive, semantics-aware solution for interoperability of heterogeneous Persistent Identifier systems. Such a solution aims to provide added-value services built on an Interoperability Knowledge Base. The IF ontology refinement and the related prototype specifics have been designed adopting a bottom-up approach that starts from a)the analysis of metadata provided by Content Providers and b)the collection of functional and semantic requirements of Persistent Identifier Domains (PID to fostering ontologybased metadata translation among different bodies. Conclusions and intended future work close the paper. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The HEAL10-NY grant, funded by the New York State Government, is an outcome of the state's effort to integrate hospitals, clinics and laboratories in New York. This paper discusses the mapping strategies adopted for the semantic and process interoperability between two hospital systems that have been implemented at two different clinical settings using standard vocabularies. Allscripts EMR is being used at ante/prenatal clinics to document ante/prenatal care and General Electricity's Centricity Perinatal (CPN) is being used at labor and delivery units in the hospital. Both applications differ in their content usage, software/hardware architectures, and platforms. Clinical information from these prenatal clinics/hospitals is transmitted after every visit to the RHIO, which acts as a clinical data repository and an aggregator of clinical information. At the time of admission for labor and delivery, the aggregated data is pushed to the inpatient labor and delivery system. This paper describes the usage of the recursive functions to traverse the SNOMED hierarchies to match the granularity levels of the Allscripts EMR application as well as SNOMED→ICD-9 crosswalk tables.

AB  - In recent years, videos have become more and more a familiar multimedia format for common users. In particular, the advent of Web 2.0 and the spreading of video-sharing services over the Web have led to an explosion of online video content. The capability to provide broader support in accessing and exploring video content, and in general other kind of multimedia formats as images and documents, is becoming more and more important. In this context, the value of semantically structured data and metadata is recognized as a key factor both to improve search efficiency and to guarantee data interoperability. This latter aspect is critical to connect different, heterogeneous content coming from a variety of data sources. On the other hand, the annotation of video resources has been increasingly understood as a medium factor to enable deep analysis of contents and collaborative study of online digital objects. However, as existing annotation tools provide poor support for semantically structured content or in some cases express the semantics in proprietary and non-interoperable formats, such knowledge that users build by carefully annotating contents hardly crosses the boundaries of a single system and often cannot be reused by different communities (e. g., to classify content or to discover new relations among resources). In this paper, a novel Semantic Web-based annotation system is presented that enables user annotations to form semantically structured knowledge at different levels of granularity and complexity. Annotation can be reused by external applications and mixed with Web of Data sources to enable "serendipity," the reuse of data produced for a specific task (annotation) by different people and in different contexts from the one data originated from. The main ideas behind the approach are to build on ontologies and support linking, at data level, to precise thesauri and vocabularies, as well as to the Linked Open Data cloud. By describing the software model, developed in the context of SemLib EU project, and by providing an implementation of an online video annotation tool, the main aim of this paper is to demonstrate how such technologies can enable a scenario where users annotations are created while browsing the Web, naturally shared among users, stored in machine readable format and then possibly recombined with external data and ontologies to enhance end-user experience. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Huge amounts of high-throughput screening (HTS) data for probe and drug development projects are being generated in the pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector. The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results. BAO leverages description logic to formalize the domain knowledge and facilitate the semantic integration with diverse other resources. As a consequence, BAO offers the potential to infer new knowledge from a corpus of assay results, for example molecular mechanisms of action of perturbagens. © 2012 Vempati et al.

AB  - The Semantic Web (also known as the Web of Data) is growing rapidly and becoming a decentralized social and knowledge platform for publishing and sharing information. In the early days of the Semantic Web (1999-2006), research efforts of the community were centered around knowledge representation; thus, most of the research work was focused on building ontologies (ontology engineering), developing formal languages to represent them (ontology language), methodologies to evaluate and evolve ontologies (ontology evaluation and evolution (OE)), and logic for reasoning with them. As a result of this, even though ontologies were being developed but their instantiation was inadequate to provide the actual instance data needed for the evaluation and analysis of the developed ontologies. In order to overcome this issue, test data was often used to perform the above tasks [1]. However, in the recent past, the focus has shifted towards publishing data either with little or no use of ontologies [2]. This shift in focus is credited to the Linked Open Data (LOD) Project which has published billions of assertions on the Web using well known Linked Data principles. Because of this, the research focus has shifted from knowledge-centered to data-centered and is now settling down at the point where domain ontologies are being used to publish real-world data on the Web. This trend promotes consistent and coherent semantic interoperability between users, systems and applications. In this regard, several domain ontologies have been developed to describe the information pertaining to different domains such as Healthcare and Life Science (HCLS), governments, social spaces, libraries, entertainment, financial service and eCommerce. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - During the past two decades, e-government information systems have become less paper-based and more computer-based. Those information systems usually take the form of workflow systems. Due to the large social impact of e-government systems, computer security plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficiency and effectiveness. Access control is one of the key aspects of computer security. Current access control models do not take into account the context of the system and its environment. In this article, we argue that a formal context-sensitive access control model can improve the development of e-government workflow systems and present a particular context-sensitive access control model. The subject of the article is a specification of the context-sensitive access control model for business processes (COBAC). By using a context-sensitive access control, it is possible to define more sophisticated access control policies that cannot be implemented by existing access control models. The COBAC's context is modeled using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in order to provide formal representation of context, rich representation of diverse contextual information, semantic interoperability between various context-aware systems, and a high degree of inference making. The presented model is applicable in different e-government systems, and supports the definition of access control policies for both simple and complex business processes. The model's prototype is verified by a case study on a real e-government business process-the national petty offense trial proceedings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Information integration is a key for further growth of efficiency in management decisions for the railway domain. In the context of the EU project InteGRail (funded in the 6th framework programme) an integration approach leveraged by ontologies known from the semantic web and logic-based reasoning mechanisms has been successfully demonstrated. To this effect existing heterogeneous monitoring data acquired across the European railways (in the context of rolling stock, infrastructure, operations and traffic management) is logically integrated according to a formal information model. Based on distributed reasoning mechanism decentralised data and inferred knowledge does not have to be aggregated in a central repository but can be transparently accessed by applications independently from where it is acquired. We explain how the proposed techniques facilitate integration, analysis and interpretation of distributed observation data in the railway domain. In addition, the implementation of the presented approach is presented by a demonstration scenario, which integrates existing real-world data for symptom identification and incipient fault detection. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - Information superiority is one of the primary issues for Network Enabled Capabilities (NEC) in future crisis management operations that will have to operate in an environment of efficient collaboration and informed decision making in a value network. Exploiting the network-enabled information flows turns out to be the only effective way to meet the challenges and threats we face in this modern, interconnected world. Enhanced inter-agency and inter-company communication and collaboration has been defined as the capability to deliver information superiority whenever required to enable agile and informed decision making to underpin effects-based operations: delivering the right effect, at the right time, to achieve the outcome required. Challenges and threats in our modern world are global and multi-faceted requiring complex responses: governments and corporations buoyed by the realization that the interests of both are mutually engage, are pursuing joint corporate social responsibility to make life and business conduct safe and sustainable. One outcome is increasing openness: organizations increasingly publish data and knowledge in open formats and open spaces and (others) provide tools to gain insight from this open and openly accessible data. Network enablement increases inclusion and participation of people in all domains of private and public life; internet-enabled social networking contributes to data available for analysis and better understanding of human factors. This case study summarizes technology-based social responsibility trends and illustrates how emerging technologies like visual analytics on spatio-temporal data can achieve semantic interoperability and transparency within large amounts of data linked through ontologies and common metadata models.

AB  - According to the Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations (ISA) Programme of the European Commission, interoperability relates to the ability of disparate organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial and agreed goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge [1]. Semantic assets and the agreements associated with them are essential elements for organisations to understand the meaning of the information they exchange - without them this information would be of little use. In this paper, semantic assets are defined as ontologies, data models, data dictionaries, code lists, XML and RDF schemas which are used for information exchange and that can be reused by implementers of Information Systems, in particular, as part of machine-to-machine interfaces. However, field research has shown that developers, practitioners and researchers working in the field of semantic interoperability in eGovernment tend to reinvent the wheel and semantic assets are rarely reused. In order to encourage and bootstrap the reuse of semantic assets in the EU and beyond, this paper introduces two important initiatives driven by the ISA Programme: the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) and the ADMS-enabled federation of semantic asset repositories on Joinup.

AB  - E-governance system promotes transparency, quick access to information but it lacks human-machine interpretation. Semantic Web based solutions for E-Governance provide real time intelligence by making the machine understand the information and takes intelligent decision by integrating heterogeneous data from distributed sources in more autonomous way. In existing E-Governance, duplicate information spread throughout different department datasets. Failing to maintain consistent information across the datasets of departments leads to incorrect and unreliable result to the user query. The e-services themselves are not interoperable, hence it makes difficult for the citizen to access the services and it is not possible to refine a new service. This paper aims at the design of semantic web based Indian E-Governance system for connecting the distributed heterogeneous data of various e-services. The proposed method creates a unique access point for the services so that they can be easily accessed and interconnected. In order to maintain consistent citizen information, common citizen ontology is built and shared among the e-services of certain government departments. The proposed system uses the unique-id for the citizen to enable easy integration of distributed data of various services and greater service delivery. This method also effectively increases the efficiency of data management. The proposed system allows the user to select any service using dedicated URI and make a query from anywhere at any time. After the semantic translation, the user query is sent to the semantic server. The agent with the help of knowledge base automatically finds and integrates the relevant information from various services and gives the correct decision to the user. Thus, semantically enabled e-governance framework provides intelligent inference for the user query and efficient accessibility of all services. The proposed system makes the maintenance easier as it allows for the information reuse, interoperability, sharing and automatic discovery of new services. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.

AB  - The field of predictive toxicology requires the development of open, public, computable, standardized toxicology vocabularies and ontologies to support the applications required by in silico, in vitro, and in vivo toxicology methods and related analysis and reporting activities. In this article we review ontology developments based on a set of perspectives showing how ontologies are being used in predictive toxicology initiatives and applications. Perspectives on resources and initiatives reviewed include OpenTox, eTOX, Pistoia Alliance, ToxWiz, Virtual Liver, EU-ADR, BEL, ToxML, and Bioclipse. We also review existing ontology developments in neighboring fields that can contribute to establishing an ontological framework for predictive toxicology. A significant set of resources is already available to provide a foundation for an ontological framework for 21st century mechanistic-based toxicology research. Ontologies such as ToxWiz provide a basis for application to toxicology investigations, whereas other ontologies under development in the biological, chemical, and biomedical communities could be incorporated in an extended future framework. OpenTox has provided a semantic web framework for the implementation of such ontologies into software applications and linked data resources. Bioclipse developers have shown the benefit of interoperability obtained through ontology by being able to link their workbench application with remote OpenTox web services. Although these developments are promising, an increased international coordination of efforts is greatly needed to develop a more unified, standardized, and open toxicology ontology framework.

AB  - Huge amounts of high-throughput screening (HTS) data are generated in the pharmaceutical industry and more recently in the public sector. These are typically analyzed on a per-project basis. Comparison and analysis across many diverse HTS datasets are hindered by the lack of standardized descriptions of biological assays and screening results. Here, we present the BioAssay Ontology (BAO), which enables the categorization of biological assays by concepts relevant to interpret and compare HTS data and thus facilitates data analysis across many HTS campaigns. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository. PubChem. Here we demonstrate how BAO can be applied to access and analyze HTS data. BAO makes use of expressive description logic and has potential for discovering implicit knowledge using inference. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology. org/ontologies/44531.

AB  - Semantic interoperability is an objective that has been addressed in many research projects and publications in the past by the development or presentation of new artefacts (approaches, ontologies, tools, etc.). Mostly, different aspects of semantic interoperability have been addressed, which distinguished these artefacts from each other. But on the other hand, all these artefacts have one characteristic in common: they are big, complex,complicated, not easy to understand for people who are not familiar with the concepts and technology of the Semantic Web, and (sometimes) not easy to integrate into legacy systems. But this is crucial in the context of public administration, because there are small- and medium-sized public authorities, e.g., municipalities with limited resources, as well as big and advanced public authorities with a sufficient amount of resources, but existing information systems that cannot be replaced easily, e.g., because they are customized to local needs. In this work in progress paper the question is posed, how the technology regarding the facilitation of semantic interoperability can be simplified, so that these concepts and technology are first of all more understandable to employees and second easier to implement in small- and medium-sized public authorities like municipalities. A deliberation on this question promises the possibility, that the barriers for using these concepts and technology in municipality can be reduced and, that the municipalities can take advantage of these concepts and technology. Some ideas how this question can be approached are outlined in this poster paper.

AB  - The ultimate goal of e-governance is to reach the stage of seamless service delivery in one-stop eGovernment. This raises the engineering issues of integration, reusability, maintenance and interoperability of autonomous eGovernment systems of government departments and agencies. Therefore, appropriate methodologies which consistently address the aforementioned engineering issues throughout eGovernment development phases are needed. This study presents a methodology framework which amalgamates features from maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains for a unified and agile semantic-driven development of eGovernment systems. Firstly, the methods and techniques currently used for the planning, design, and implementation of eGovernment systems worldwide are investigated; a critical analysis is carried out to identify their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their contribution towards addressing the aforementioned engineering issues. Secondly, the proposed methodology framework is drawn and described. Finally, a flowchart is used to specify the iterative and incremental business process model of the proposed methodology framework. The aims of the study are twofold: (1), providing direction for the semantic-driven development of future eGovernment systems which would facilitate their integration and interoperability towards onestop eGovernment, and (2), unifying the currently used methods and techniques for efficient planning and implementation of future eGovernment systems based on semantic technologies. The main contribution of the study is the investigation and amalgamation of features from the maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains to enable the planning and agile semantic-driven implementation of future eGovernment systems. The research would be of interest to eGovernment project teams, particularly those of developing countries where little or no progress has been made towards the development of one-stop portals for online services delivery to citizens.

AB  - This work describes a new NSF funded INTEROP project organized by the Spatial Ontology Community of Practice (SOCoP, www.socop.org). Geospatial data, which give location information for geographic features, are pervasive across many disciplines and fundamental for diverse applications, such as economic development, natural resources, environmental protection, and emergency response. But, re-using geospatial data remains difficult because of its heterogeneity. Although progress has been made by initiatives such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and Geospatial One-Stop to distribute data, it is now necessary to address issues of standards harmonization and agreement on the meanings of relevant concepts in diverse data sets due to different community views. The lack of semantic interoperability has been recognized as a stumbling block to collaboration. As a solution, well designed, formal ontologies, relying on agreements between communities on unambiguous representation of concepts and relationships for a given problem area, can be used as an analytic tool to bridge community gaps. The purpose of this INTEROP project is to create opportunities for the geospatial community to work on semantic agreements and use semantic mappings and other emerging Semantic Web technologies. An initial INTEROP Network is based on the existing SOCoP network that has a core group of active participants from academia, government, and industry. We now want to broaden the Network to cover various domains and include more participants. One of the purposes of this paper is to include the ASPRS community and gather additional use cases.

AB  - Semantic Web technologies are increasingly being adopted in e-government to describe and specify e-government services, aiming at their semantic integration and interoperability. However, current research does not provide guidelines on how domain ontology describing government's domain knowledge can be formally represented to enable their automatic processing by computers. This paper presents a case study of transforming domain ontology in Sub Saharan Africa and the developing world at large, into its formal version in e-government processes, aiming at (1) providing e-government developers from developing countries as well as Sub Saharan Africa, with simple activities for practicing semantic knowledge representation in e-government projects, (2) promoting the development of e-government systems that can be easily integrated and maintained, as well as (3) strengthening the adoption of Semantic Web technologies in e-government projects in developing countries. © 2011 IIMC LTD.

AB  - The increasing volume of eGovernment-related services is demanding new approaches for service integration and interoperability in this domain. Semantic web (SW) technologies and applications can leverage the potential of eGovernment service integration and discovery, thus tackling the problems of semantic heterogeneity characterizing eGovernment information sources and the different levels of interoperability. eGovernment services will therefore be semantically described in the foreseeable future. In an environment with semantically annotated services, software agents are essential as the entities responsible for exploiting the semantic content in order to automate some tasks, and so enhance the user's experience. In this paper, we present a framework that provides a seamless integration of semantic web services and intelligent agents technologies by making use of ontologies to facilitate their interoperation. The proposed framework can assist in the development of powerful and flexible distributed systems in complex, dynamic, heterogeneous, unpredictable and open environments. Our approach is backed up by a proof-of-concept implementation, where the breakthrough of integrating disparate eGovernment services has been tested. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Service description frameworks and relevant metadata appear as a key enabler that assists management of resources related to the provision of personalized, efficient and proactive services oriented towards the real citizens' needs. As different authorities typically use different terms to describe their resources and publish them in various Digital Service Registries that may enhance the access to and delivery of governmental knowledge, but also need to communicate seamlessly at a national and pan-European level, the need for a unified digital public service metadata standard emerges. This paper presents the creation of an ontology-based extended metadata set that embraces services, documents, XML Schemas, code lists, public bodies and information systems. Such a metadata set formalizes the exchange of information between portals and registries and assists the service transformation and simplification efforts, while it can be further taken into consideration when applying Web 2.0 techniques in governance. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The paper presents a software framework that was designed and implemented within the FP6 IST EU project Access-eGov to integrate governmental services of various types, i.e. on-line (electronic and web services), as well as off-line (i.e. traditional, face-toface) services by means of enhancing the service description with semantic information. The user-centric approach of life events is employed for presenting complex workflow sequences to the end users. The system architecture, functionality, and structure of underlying ontologies is described together with a mechanism for the orchestration and choreography of semantic web services in WSMO. The framework includes tools for the maintenance of semantically enriched services and for presenting the services to the citizens via customisable web interfaces. The paper concludes with an outline of the results obtained from the testing and evaluation of the implemented Access-eGov platform in real settings within public administrations in Slovakia, Poland, and Germany.

AB  - European Regional Policy produced several generations of programmes at both National and Regional levels. Such a complex framework tends to increase multi-level governance in the period 2007-2013, promoting a wider participation of stakeholders (including Public Administration, Local Communities, Enterprises, etc). This process has been usually accompanied by e-tools for the management of bottom-up processes, with several instances related to common problems of participation processes. Communication between " programmer" and categories of beneficiaries always presented weakness due to the ineffective system of management knowledge within the process. Relevant issues in the framework of regional development programmes are: Do stakeholders understand the meaning of general and sectoral policies? Are citizens aware of technical instruments implementing such policies? Are they conscious of ex-ante comprehensive context analysis and/or can they share possible future scenarios? A way to tackle these problems is the use of ontologies.In this work we present the structural elements of the ontology of regional development programmes analyzing major steps of the ontology design and nodal phases of the ontology building (i.e. consensus on relations and restrictions, switch from glossary to taxonomy). The result of such an application is an ontology of regional development. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Interoperability is one of the most challenging problems in modern cross-organizational information systems, which rely on heterogeneous information and process models. Interoperability becomes very important for e-Government information systems that support cross-organizational communication especially in a cross-border setting. The main goal in this context is to seamlessly provide integrated services to the user (citizen). In this paper we focus on Pan European e-Services and issues related with their integration. Our analysis uses basic concepts of the generic public service model of the Governance Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and of the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), to express the semantic description of the e-services. Based on the above, we present a mediation infrastructure capable of resolving semantic interoperability conflicts at a pan-European level. We provide several examples to illustrate both the need to solve such semantic conflicts and the actual solutions we propose. © 2011 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Context-aware (CA) systems have demonstrated the provision of a robust solution for personalized information delivery in the current content-rich and dynamic information age we live in. They allow software agents to autonomously interact with users by modeling the user's environment (e.g. profile, location, relevant public information etc.) as dynamically-evolving and interoperable contexts. There is a flurry of research activities in a wide spectrum at context-aware research areas such as managing the user's profile, context acquisition from external environments, context storage, context representation and interpretation, context service delivery and matching of context attributes to users 'queries etc. We propose SDCAS, a Semantic-Driven Context Aware System that facilitates public services recommendation to users at temporal location. This paper focuses on information management and service recommendation using semantic technologies, taking into account the challenges of relationship complexity in temporal and contextual information. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The paper describes an approach to semantic interoperability of eGovernment services applied within the 027020 FP6 IST Access-eGov project. The goal of the project was to improve accessibility and connectivity of governmental services for citizens and businesses by means of creating integrated scenarios and providing guidance to users while following this scenario. The scenario helps the user to identify and fulfil any needed electronic or real governmental services in a selected life situation. The Access-eGov project has developed software tools enabling service integration using semantic technologies. In addition to that, a methodology providing guidance to the user-driven process of creating ontologies was developed. Sample ontologies were prepared for trial applications. The developed tools support browsing, discovery, and execution of government services according to a selected life event or goal. The project successfully developed and tested the proposed solutions. The software developed within the project is available as open source software. © 2011 Universidad de Talca - Chile.

AB  - Ontologies are at the heart of the semantic web. They define the concepts and relationships that make global interoperability possible. However, as these ontologies grow in size they become more and more difficult to create, use, understand, maintain, transform and classify. As ontologies become common in more applications and as those applications become larger and longer-lived, it is becoming increasingly common for ontologies to be developed in different area of public sector of economics. Ontologies present special challenges to the problem of conceptual modeling. This paper describes the process of the implementation of a subontology of forecasting and evaluations for business analysis domain in order to develop an easy and correct way to find the needed statistical information in a knowledge base.

AB  - Objective: This paper introduces the objectives, methods and results of ontology development in the EU co-funded project Advancing Clinico-genomic Trials on Cancer - Open Grid Services for Improving Medical Knowledge Discovery (ACGT). While the available data in the life sciences has recently grown both in amount and quality, the full exploitation of it is being hindered by the use of different underlying technologies, coding systems, category schemes and reporting methods on the part of different research groups. The goal of the ACGT project is to contribute to the resolution of these problems by developing an ontology-driven, semantic grid services infrastructure that will enable efficient execution of discovery-driven scientific workflows in the context of multi-centric, post-genomic clinical trials. The focus of the present paper is the ACGT Master Ontology (MO). Methods: ACGT project researchers undertook a systematic review of existing domain and upper-level ontologies, as well as of existing ontology design software, implementation methods, and end-user interfaces. This included the careful study of best practices, design principles and evaluation methods for ontology design, maintenance, implementation, and versioning, as well as for use on the part of domain experts and clinicians. Results: To date, the results of the ACGT project include (i) the development of a master ontology (the ACGT-MO) based on clearly defined principles of ontology development and evaluation; (ii) the development of a technical infrastructure (the ACGT Platform) that implements the ACGT-MO utilizing independent tools, components and resources that have been developed based on open architectural standards, and which includes an application updating and evolving the ontology efficiently in response to end-user needs; and (iii) the development of an Ontology-based Trial Management Application (ObTiMA) that integrates the ACGT-MO into the design process of clinical trials in order to guarantee automatic semantic integration without the need to perform a separate mapping process. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Ontologies are widely proposed for solving semantic interoperability problems in e-government domain. However, less attention is paid on methodological issues of ontology development in this domain. These are not sufficiently solved. Existing approaches in ontology development are technically very demanding and require long learning curve and are therefore inefficient for this purpose. E-government domain ontologies could be efficiently developed by domain experts rather than ontology engineers. The paper proposes a novel ontology development methodology for construction of light-weight domain ontologies by bringing ontology modeling closer to domain experts that are actual domain knowledge holders. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by development of a network of e-government domain ontologies used for achieving semantic interoperability of state information systems (IS) in Estonia. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2011.

AB  - The Public Service ontology provides researchers and practitioners with a formal, standardised and unambiguous way for modelling public services. To develop the Public Service ontology, a formal ontology development methodology was followed and a generic Public Administration (PA) service model (Peristeras and Tarabanis, 2008) was used as a blueprint. The ontology played the role of the PA Service ontology in the SemanticGov project. The Public Service ontology has also been used for resolving semantic interoperability problems between different PA information systems and for creating Semantic Web Service with rich PA domain semantics.

AB  - One common and primary vision of eHealth is to achieve seamless interoperability between eHealth systems to enable the delivery of the right information about the right patient to the right person at the right time. However, the high sensitivity of the clinical domain and the vast differences in eHealth systems pose a great interoperability challenge for solutions that rely solely on prior knowledge of common interoperability standards will not sufficiently scale. This chapter presents a service-based approach that utilises domain ontologies combined with extensible problem models, enriched with domain terminology and knowledge services to enable autonomous data governance and semantic interoperability. The chapter addresses the resulting requirements and proposes a solution outlining the results from the prototype of the approach. © 2012 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - European Regional Policy produced several generations of programmes at both National and Regional levels. Such a complex framework tends to increase multi-level governance in the period 2007-2013, promoting a wider participation of stakeholders (including Public Administration, Local Communities, Enterprises, etc). This process has been usually accompanied by e-tools for the management of bottom-up processes, with several instances related to common problems of participation processes. Communication between " programmer" and categories of beneficiaries always presented weakness due to the ineffective system of management knowledge within the process. Relevant issues in the framework of regional development programmes are: Do stakeholders understand the meaning of general and sectoral policies? Are citizens aware of technical instruments implementing such policies? Are they conscious of ex-ante comprehensive context analysis and/or can they share possible future scenarios? A way to tackle these problems is the use of ontologies. In this work we present the structural elements of the ontology of regional development programmes analyzing major steps of the ontology design and nodal phases of the ontology building (i.e. consensus on relations and restrictions, switch from glossary to taxonomy). The result of such an application is an ontology of regional development containing more than one hundred classes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - E-government faces huge challenges in achieving interoperability and integration, taking into account differences in laws, regulations, services, administrative processes and languages across regions and countries. On the other hand, issues like service, data and process integration have been researched by the Semantic Web community for several years now, and in the last two to three years we have witnessed the first applications of semantic technologies in real, operational e-government systems in both Europe and the US which address exactly these challenges. With this book, the editors present the latest research results on how to use semantic technologies in order to improve or even revolutionize the use of ICT in public administration systems. The contributions are organized into three parts: architectures and process integration, ontologies and interoperability, and portals and user interactions. They give a broad overview of how semantic technologies have been applied in different e-government projects funded from the European program for ICT Research and Development, and they cover a wide spectrum of semantic technologies such as development of domain and service ontologies, semantic enhancements of business process models, semantic Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) based on Semantic Web Services (SWS) frameworks, and ontology-based knowledge management. In this volume, researchers of Semantic Web technologies will find a wealth of challenging real-world scenarios to stimulate new fields of research, while developers of e-government systems as well as other stakeholders in public administration will appreciate the detailed presentations and discussions of numerous applications in areas such as e-government portals, personalization of Web-based public services, or integration and orchestration of public administration processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

AB  - CSI-Piemonte is a regional public agency with the legal status of a Consortium, organized along private lines, owned by several public stakeholders of the Piemonte area, acting in the field of information technology and telecommunication. CSI-Piemonte, as ICT body of the Local Public Administration, manages a great deal of data, both alphanumeric and geographic, which altogether represent a wide set of detailed description of the regional data patrimony. According to the document European Interoperability Framework (EIF), interoperability consists in the ability from part of systems ICT and supported processes to exchange data and to share information and knowledge. In particular EIF identifies three fundamental levels of interoperability to consider: organizational interoperability, semantic interoperability and technical interoperability. In this perspective the so-called semantic interoperability has a fundamental role. The definition of semantic interoperability to the inside of the document is following: "Semantic Interoperability is concerned with ensuring that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose. Semantic interoperability enables systems to combine received information with other information resources and to process it in a meaningful manner." According to the perspective of the semantic interoperability, it's not to characterize reusable data formats, but to comprise, to make exploitation, to connect between the various shadings of meant that these assume in the practical one of the administrative procedures, to the aim to render the effective composition and unification of various services possible. The technology key in order to face this problem is today that one of the so-called ontologies, data structures that they describe the meant one of the terms uses you from a computer science application or an organization so that the computers (but also the men) can reason on the relations between such terms, characterizing similarity and differences of meant. Data and service requests are currently generated and managed in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, different actors (e.g., service providers, product sellers, governmental organizations) need to exchange data in a wealth of different formats. To allow an effective information exchange, systems need to support interoperability, thus enabling the sharing of information and knowledge. To this end, a general-purpose exchange data model needs to be defined. The following described experiences propose a conceptual box contaning: - in the lower parts, metadata and data of portal objects - in the upper parts, conceptual data models ("light" ontologies) Semantics criteria extracts knowledge from lower parts, light ontologies validates knowledge. Upper intelligence increments lower intelligence, and viceversa. This generalized methods allows knowledge reuse, experimented with Central Public Administration vs. Local Public Administration. Any kinds of light ontologies, in coherence with lower level, can infer and reuse knowledge, for example also for other European Public Administration.

One of the principal objectives of the initial project setup was the creation of a repository of semantic interoperability assets for pan-European eGovernment projects. eGovernment arrived at the opportunities of semantic technologies. A recent poll by SEMIC.EU showed: Over 80 per cent of respondents indicated they have used or are going to use ontologies in the next 12 months. European public administration has realized the potential of ontological solutions for its purposes.

AB  - E-services, based on automated data exchange in distributed technological and organizational environment, are an effective way to build cross-border, controlled information services. Processes of creation, integration, management, reuse, discovery and composition of e-services are not very efficient without understanding the meaning of information resources. Creation and management of human and machine readable semantics of heterogeneous and distributed information resources are more complicated than coordinated documentation process, and require new interoperability principles, architecture and infrastructure. This paper outlines the idea and architecture of the Estonian semantic interoperability initiative in the public sector. The paper presents a collaborative ontology engineering toolset and repository as a part of interoperability infrastructure, built with Semantic Mediawiki, to manage the semantics of information resources.

AB  - By improving the quality of e-government services by enabling access to services across different government agencies through one portal, services integration plays a key role in e-government development. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of ontology based e-government service integration, using Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Scholarship Program (SAKASP) as a case study. SAKASP is a multi-domain program in which students must collect information from various Ministries to complete applications and the administering authority must verify the information supplied by the Ministries. The current implementation of SAKASP is clumsy because it is a mixture of online submission and manual collection and verification of information; its time-consuming and tedious procedures are inconvenient for the applicants and inefficient for the administrators. The proposed framework provides an integrated service by employing semantic web service (SWS) and ontology, improving the current implementation of SAKASP by automatically collecting and processing the related information for a given application. The article includes a typical scenario that demonstrates the workflow of the framework. This framework is applicable to other multi-domain e-government services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

AB  - ESservices, based on automated data exchange in distributed technological and organizational environment, are an effective way to build cross-border, controlled information services. Processes of creation, integration, management, reuse, discovery and composition of eServices are not very efficient without understanding the meaning of information resources. Creation and management of human and machine readable semantics of heterogeneous and distributed information resources are more complicated than coordinated documentation process, and require new interoperability principles, architecture and infrastructure. This paper outlines the idea and architecture of the Estonian semantic interoperability initiative in the public sector. The paper presents a collaborative ontology engineering toolset and repository as a part of interoperability infrastructure, built with Semantic Mediawiki, to manage the semantics of information resources.

AB  - This chapter presents a case of a centralised and collaborative approach to interoperability in public administration: SEMIC.EU, the Semantic Interoperability Centre Europe. SEMIC.EU is a horizontal measure of the European Commission implemented with the primary purpose of enhancing semantic interoperability in public administrations and projects across Europe. The European Commission service calls on projects and individuals alike to share their solutions for semantic interoperability (so called "assets") or to find them through a joint effort. A standardised clearing process governs the evolution of the contributed data models, XML schemas, code lists and ontologies and gives guidance to potential re-users. The chapter argues that especially at a high level of administration like the European one, the guiding principles for common solutions to semantic interoperability coordination must be. exchange of existing practices and community-based negotiation of purposes and meanings. © 2011, IGI Global.

AB  - In the KeyToNature project a user-centred and collaborative approach for metadata repository management was developed. KeyToNature is an EU project to enhance the knowledge of biodiversity by improving the availability of digital and non-digital media along with digital tools for the identification of living organisms throughout Europe. To improve the ability to search and access information, metadata are provided and integrated into a metadata repository. This paper presents a method utilizing web-based MediaWiki system as part of a low-tech interoperability and repository layer for data providers, end users, developers, and project partners. Because the level of technological expertise of the data providers varies greatly, a solution accessible for non-expert data providers was developed. The main features of this method are the automatic metadata repository management, and an ontological approach with ingestion workflows integrated into MediaWiki collaborative framework. Extensive user testing shows performance advantages of the method and attests usefulness in the application area. This practice-oriented method can be adopted by other projects aiming at collaborative knowledge acquisition and automatic metadata repository management, regardless of domain of discourse.

AB  - Critical infrastructures (CI) such as telecommunication or the power grids and their dependencies are getting increasingly complex. Understanding these - often indirect - dependencies is a vital precondition for the prevention of crosssector cascading failures of CI. Simulation is an important tool for CI dependency analysis, the test of methods for risk reduction, and as well for the evaluation of past failures. Moreover, interaction of such simulations with external threat models, e.g., a river flood model and economic models, may assist in what-if decision-making processes. The simulation of complex scenarios involving several different CI sectors requires the usage of heterogeneous federated simulations of CI. However, common standards for modelling and interoperability of such federated CI simulations are missing. In this paper, we present a novel approach for coupling CI simulations, developed and realised in the EU project DIESIS. The DIESIS core technologies for coupling CI simulations include a middleware that enables semantic interoperability of the federate simulators, a systematic, service-oriented approach to set up and run such federations, and, most importantly, a scenario-based architecture concept for modelling and federated simulation of CI. The architecture foresees a flexible pair-wise (lateral) coupling of simulators. DIESIS has implemented a demonstrator as a proof of concept for its approach and technologies, by coupling four different simulation systems (three interacting CIs and an external, common threat). In this paper, we focus on the architectural concept and the interoperability middleware that realises this concept and allows the coupling of heterogeneous simulation systems using various time and data models. We show how the ontology-based Knowledge Based System (KBS) is integrated and used in the overall system. Then, we discuss the basic technical concepts as well as the results obtained with the demonstrator. The proposed architecture is open for further extensions. Ultimately, the proposed approach shall form the basis of a future standard coupling middleware for federated CI simulations. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Public institutes often face the challenge of managing vast volumes of administrative documents, a need that is often met via Content Management Systems (CMSs). CMSs offer various advantages, like separation of data structure from presentation and variety in user roles, but also present certain disadvantages, like inefficient keyword-based search facilities. The new generation of content management solutions imports the notion of semantics and is based on Semantic Web technologies, such as metadata and ontologies. The benefits include semantic interoperability, competitive advantages and dramatic cost reduction. In this paper a leading Enterprise CMS is extended with semantic capabilities for automatically importing and exporting ontologies. This functionality enables reuse of repository content, semantically-enabled search and interoperability with third-party applications. The extended system is deployed in semantically managing the large volumes of documents for a state university. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Geographic information is a prerequisite for good governance. There are various urban geographic information system projects that have been produced by local governments all over the world. However, there are technical difficulties, a lack of spatial data standards and specific policies governing geographic information system projects. The result of the current situation is that the process of data collection is sometimes inefficient and the quality of the data may be inadequate. Furthermore, there are problems with managing projects and sharing data. The key to resolving these problems is to develop a harmonised geographic information model for the urban governance of Turkey. The model should fulfill the application-driven geographic data needs of local governments and support decision-making processes at regional and national levels. The domain model is an object-relational model and the starting point for creating sector models. The generic conceptual model components were defined to harmonise geographic data and to produce data specifications. In order to enable semantic interoperability unified modelling language has produced the application schemas for data themes such as administrative unit, address, cadastre/building, hydrographic, topography, geodesy, transportation, and land cover/use. The model has been tested and revised with local applications such as economic and demographic spatial analysis cases.

AB  - The availability of public administration semantic Web services is strictly linked to the availability of knowledge resources. In particular their interoperability allows knowledge sharing and reuse, so to provide integrated services in a distributed environment. In this paper a machine learning technique for guaranteeing thesaural interoperability by conceptual mapping within an information retrieval framework is presented. In particular the case of thesaural interopearbility for cross-collection legal information retrieval services at EU level is shown. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Antibiotics resistance development poses a significant problem in today's hospital care. Massive amounts of clinical data are being collected and stored in proprietary and unconnected systems in heterogeneous format. The DebugIT EU project promises to make this data geographically and semantically interoperable for case-based knowledge analysis approaches aiming at the discovery of patterns that help to align antibiotics treatment schemes. The semantic glue for this endeavor is DCO, an application ontology that enables data miners to query distributed clinical information systems in a semantically rich and content driven manner. DCO will hence serve as the core component of the interoperability platform for the DebugIT project. Here we present DCO and an approach thet uses the semantic web query language SPARQL to bind and ontologically query hospital database content using DCO and information model mediators. We provide a query example that indicates that ontological querying over heterogeneous information models is feasible via SPARQL construct- and resource mapping queries. © 2010 IMIA and SAHIA.

AB  - In the last few years crucial issues like cross-language legal information retrieval, document classification, legal knowledge discovery and extraction have been considered in theory and in practice. The availability of services allowing cross-language and cross-collection retrieval is a growing necessity. This paper focuses on the need to develop solutions for automatic, language-independent procedures to provide interoperability between mono/poly-lingual thesauri at national and European levels. This will guarantee sustainable and scalable services enabling to manage the multilingual complexity of the European Union legal context to be used for cross-language and cross-collection legal information retrieval. Wider use of the service can also be envisaged as support to legal translation services, as well as in general to promote integration and sharing of widespread and heterogeneous legal resources, providing new market opportunities for stakeholders to exploit the economic potential of public sector information in a multilanguage environment. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Models and methods for operational risks assessment and mitigation are gaining importance in financial institutions, healthcare organizations, industry, businesses and organisations in general. This book introduces modern Operational Risk Management and describes how various data sources of different types, both numeric and semantic sources such as text can be integrated and analyzed. The book also demonstrates how Operational Risk Management is synergetic to other risk management activities such as Financial Risk Management and Safety Management. Operational Risk Management: a practical approach to intelligent data analysis provides practical and tested methodologies for combining structured and unstructured, semantic-based data, and numeric data, in Operational Risk Management (OpR) data analysis. Key Features: The book is presented in four parts: 1) Introduction to OpR Management, 2) Data for OpR Management, 3) OpR Analytics and 4) OpR Applications and its Integration with other Disciplines. Explores integration of semantic, unstructured textual data, in Operational Risk Management. Provides novel techniques for combining qualitative and quantitative information to assess risks and design mitigation strategies. Presents a comprehensive treatment of "near-misses" data and incidents in Operational Risk Management. Looks at case studies in the financial and industrial sector. Discusses application of ontology engineering to model knowledge used in Operational Risk Management. Many real life examples are presented, mostly based on the MUSING project co-funded by the EU FP6 Information Society Technology Programme. It provides a unique multidisciplinary perspective on the important and evolving topic of Operational Risk Management. The book will be useful to operational risk practitioners, risk managers in banks, hospitals and industry looking for modern approaches to risk management that combine an analysis of structured and unstructured data. The book will also benefit academics interested in research in this field, looking for techniques developed in response to real world problems. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - E-government is increasing its momentum internationally, but the present E-Governance is suffering from lack of interoperability, resource sharing, operation integration and concept of collaborative work. Semantic web services has the potential to overcomes this problem. This paper explains how semantic web services can be used to support successful e-Government initiatives by connecting system design to a shared understanding of interactions and processes. We also discuss the middleware for implanting the e-Governance one-stop portal, conceptual architecture of s emantic web service based e-governance. We illustrated a use case scenario in the context of livelihood development of a country like India.

AB  - During the last years worldwide many initiatives come up to improve the quality of public services information. In Europethis process is mainly initiated by the European service directive. Germany actually has started a special project called D115, which shall provide a simple, quick and efficient access to public service information German-wide by using a single phone number 115. One technical problem in the context of D115 is the intelligent and quick routing of incoming calls to the enquiry offices, another is the technical integration and maintenance of the existing public service information repositories and a special semantic problem is the customer-orientated identification, description and the functional exchange of this knowledge between the participating organizations and public service centres. The general goal of this project is building up a virtual network of service centres with one face to the customer like citizens and enterprises, which ensures valid and quick access to information about all available public services in Germany. A crucial prerequisite to reach this goal is the semantic integration of the distributed knowledge about public services that can be found in different locations, organizations and formats mostly formulated in an inconsistent and sometimes misunderstandable manner. Given the multitude and diversity of public authorities, e. g. there are more than 12,000 municipalities in Germany, an intelligent and flexible solution to integrate these different service repositories is needed. During the last years different semantic approaches in general based on ontologies were developed to integrate distributed information about public services. Theses approaches mainly focus on formal and structural aspects of public service descriptions, i.e. which attributes or characteristics should be used to describe a public service. But concepts and solutions for an effective and valid harmonizing of the semantic differences are not available or address thisissueonly partially. In this paper existing approaches for describing public services are examined in regard to the requirements and constraints of public service centres and in the context of the project D115. Furthermore a new approach to define and build of a taxonomy of public services to support the process of providing information in public service centres is proposed. This approach is based on results of a research project of the University of Duisburg-Essen within the context of the D115 initiative in cooperation with the service centres of several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia. The project was designed to gather the requirements for a classification system of public services from the perspective of public service centres as well as to verify the feasibility of this approach in the service centre praxis.

AB  - In this article we present a first experimentation of a Business Intelligence solution to dynamically develop multidimensional OLAP schemas through a reuse of ontologies, stored in concept and relations dictionaries and used by semantic indexing engines. The particular aspect of the proposed solution consists in the integration of semantic indexing techniques of non-structured documents, based on ontologies, with dynamic management techniques of unbalanced hierarchies in a Data Warehouse. As a case study, we embedded our solution into a real system, built for the analysis and management of experts' curricula in an e-government environment. We show how it is possible to automatically build OLAP dimensions, inheriting the hierarchic structure of ontologies, with the goal of using the semantically indexed data to carry out multidimensional OLAP analyses. The first experimental results are encouraging.

AB  - The liberalization of the electricity market in the European Union is a process of significant importance that aims at creating an efficient deregulated internal electricity market within the Union. An important challenge towards that end is definitely the development of effective market mechanisms and regulations that will comprise the operational framework of the market. Equally important, however, we consider the development of an interoperability framework that will enable the effective and unproblematic interaction between the market participants at both human and system level. Towards that direction we propose in this paper the Electricity Market Ontology (ELMO), an ontological model that provides a shared, common understanding of concepts and procedures regarding the electricity market operation. ELMO has been developed for the Hellenic Transmission System Operator (HTSO) and it is currently used by the organization for providing intelligent information access services to people interested in the market.

AB  - This paper aims to propose solutions to the issue of ontology visualization, by presenting intuitive and userfriendly ontology editing and visualization environments mainly oriented to domain experts. It starts with an overview of existing ontology visualization methods; afterwards it describes the Semantic DB system and the OWLeasyViz ontology editor. Semantic DB is a web application framework to create simple complete semantic web applications, integrating an ontology editor, a resource editor, an inference rule editor, a reasoner, and a search engine. OWLeasyViz is an ontology editor that combines a textual and a graphical representation of OWL ontologies. It meets different user needs by providing a simple and intuitive interface to end-users who are not ontologists, and offering more advanced tools to ontology experts. The OWLeasyViz editor is intended to be a module of a semantic web integrated working environment, developed within the context of a Swiss Government funded CTI applied research project in the domain of waste water management. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - Information integration is a key for further growth of efficiency in management decisions for the railway domain. In the context of the EU project InteGRail (funded in the 6th Framework Programme) an integration approach leveraged by ontologies known from the Semantic Web and logic-based reasoning mechanisms has been successfully demonstrated. To this effect existing heterogeneous monitoring data acquired across the European railways (in the context of rolling stock, infrastructure, operations and traffic management) is logically integrated according to a formal information model. Based on distributed reasoning mechanism decentralized data and inferred knowledge does not have to be aggregated in a central repository but can be transparently accessed by applications independently from where it is acquire. We explain how the proposed techniques facilitate integration, analysis and interpretation of distributed observation data in the railway domain. Finally the implementation of the presented approach is presented by a demonstration scenario, which integrates existing real-world data for symptom identification and fault detection. ©2009 IEEE.

AB  - "Global Interoperability Using Semantics, Standards, Science and Technology" is a concept that is predicated on the assumption that the semantic integration, frameworks and standards that support information exchange, and advances in science and technology can enable information-systems interoperability for many diverse users. This paper recommends technologies and approaches for enabling interoperability across a wide spectrum of political, geographical, and organizational levels, e.g. coalition, federal, state, tribal, regional, non government, and private. These recommendations represent steps toward the goal of the Semantic Web, where computers understand information on web sites through knowledge representations, agents, and ontologies.

AB  - Semantic Web technology is able to provide the required computational semantics for interoperability of learning resources across different Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Object Repositories (LOR). The EU research project LUISA (Learning Content Management System Using Innovative Semantic Web Services Architecture) addresses the development of a reference semantic architecture for the major challenges in the search, interchange, and delivery of learning objects in a serviceoriented context. One of the key issues, highlighted in this paper, is Digital Rights Management (DRM) interoperability. A Semantic Web approach to copyright management has been followed, which places a Copyright Ontology as the key component for interoperability among existing DRM systems and other licensing schemes like Creative Commons. Moreover, Semantic Web tools like reasoners, rule engines and semantic queries facilitate the implementation of an interoperable copyright management component in the LUISA architecture. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the dawn of the Semantic Web era, metadata appear as a key enabler that assists management of the e-Government resources related to the provision of personalized, efficient and proactive services oriented towards the real citizens' needs. As different authorities typically use different terms to describe their resources and publish them in various e-Government Registries that may enhance the access to and delivery of governmental knowledge, but also need to communicate seamlessly at a national and pan-European level, the need for a unified e-Government metadata standard emerges. This paper presents the creation of an ontology-based extended metadata set for e-Government Resources that embraces services, documents, XML Schemas, code lists, public bodies and information systems. Such a metadata set formalizes the exchange of information between portals and registries and assists the service transformation and simplification efforts, while it can be further taken into consideration when applying Web 2.0 techniques in e-Government. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper reviews the state of the art in the area of enhancing eGovernment interoperability by using common models and/or ontologies. This area has currently become a very active research field. We identify and present a significant number (> 40) of relevant efforts. These initiatives are grouped into categories based on the owner, scope and modelling perspective of each project. We then focus on the cases that build generic and universal eGovernment representations and models. We analyse, evaluate and rate them using an additional set of criteria. We end up with conclusions and possible directions for the exploitation and usage of these models. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over recent years, there has been a worldwide growing need for interoperability among the systems that manage and reuse public sector information. This paper explores the documentation needs for public sector information and focuses on metadata interoperability issues. The research work studies a variety of public sector information metadata standards and guidelines internationally accepted and presents two methodologies to obtain interoperability. The first develops an application profile, while the second is based on the semantic integration approach and results in the creation of an ontology. The outcomes of the two approaches are compared under the prism of their scope and usage in terms of interoperability during the metadata integration process. © CILIP.

AB  - The current work addresses the unifi cation of Electronic Health Records related to cervical cancer into a single medical knowledge source, in the context of the EU-funded ASSIST research project. The project aims to facilitate the research for cervical precancer and cancer through a system that virtually unifi es multiple patient record repositories, physically located in different medical centers/hospitals, thus, increasing fl exibility by allowing the formation of study groups "on demand" and by recycling patient records in new studies. To this end, ASSIST uses semantic technologies to translate all medical entities (such as patient examination results, history, habits, genetic profi le) and represent them in a common form, encoded in the ASSIST Cervical Cancer Ontology. The current paper presents the knowledge elicitation approach followed, towards the defi nition and representation of the disease's medical concepts and rules that constitute the basis for the ASSIST Cervical Cancer Ontology. The proposed approach constitutes a paradigm for semantic integration of heterogeneous clinical data that may be applicable to other biomedical application domains.

AB  - Interoperability is one of the most challenging problems in modern cross-organizational information systems, which rely on heterogeneous information and process models. Interoperability becomes very important for e-Government information systems that support cross-organizational communication especially in a cross-border setting. The main goal in this context is to seamlessly provide integrated services to the user (citizen). In this paper we focus on Pan European e-Services and issues related with their integration. Our analysis uses basic concepts of the generic public service model of the Governance Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and of the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), to express the semantic description of the e-services. Based on the above, we present a mediation infrastructure capable of resolving semantic interoperability conflicts at a pan-European level. We provide several examples to illustrate both the need to solve such semantic conflicts and the actual solutions we propose. [Article copies are available for purchase from InfoSci-on-Demand.com].

AB  - E-services are built upon the exchange of information between several databases and institutions. The creation process of new e-services may be not an efficient one because the discovery, integration and reuse of appropriate information resources is time-consuming as the meaning of these information resources is not well-enough documented. In order to describe the meaning of information resources - being poured into hundreds of heterogeneous databases, distributed between several institutions - some coordination, principles, architecture and infrastructure are needed. This paper outlines proposed large-scale semantic interoperability architecture and its pilot implementation in the Estonian public sector's semantic interoperability initiative. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This chapter proposes a multi-agent based framework that allows multiple data sources and models to be semantically integrated for spatial modeling in business processing. The authros introduce a multiagent system (OSIRIS – Ontology-based Spatial Information and Resource Integration Services) to semantically interoperate complex spatial services and integrate them in a meaningful composition. The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. The authors also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS using Description Logics. The system illustrates an application of domain ontology of urban environmental hydrology and evaluation of decision maker’s consequences of land use changes. In e-government context, the proposed OSIRIS framework works as semantic layer for one stop geospatial portal. © 2010 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - The model presented in this paper is the main result of an on-going national science foundation project of china, called Emergency-Driven Virtual Organization(EDVO), which aims at building and developing an innovative software infrastructure (software, models, services, etc.) for supporting collaborative work of events handling in emergency/disaster scenarios. In such scenarios, different government's departments, belonging to different organizations, need to focus on the task of integrating, conforming and scheduling heterogeneous, distributed resources from multi-domains, as well as sharing knowledge among different organizations. Therefore, knowledge representation and sharing among the participating organizations become critical problems. A knowledge representation and sharing mechanism oriented to EDVO is proposed and a corresponding support platform is designed and developed. It is shown in practice that the model is able to solve the problem of knowledge sharing in different organizations in certain EDVO and improves cooperation among those departments. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - SPCoop is a nationwide framework for supporting service interoperability in the exercise and application of Italian government policies. The very core of this framework lies in the use of Semantic Web Services as a means to execute even complex administrative processes in a semi-automatic way, hence the need for added semantic value in the definition of such services. Because each participant is responsible for both authoring its domain knowledge representation and defining the services provided, and these tasks may be performed at different times by different individuals who may or may not belong to the same domain, the problem of heterogeneous individual knowledgeability arises. Also, the set of standards that were adopted in SPCoop includes specifications that have since been replaced by newer versions and show little coverage by existing implementations. SAscha is a Web tool intended to address such issues, offering an essentially simple WYSIWYM approach to annotating Web Service descriptors with SAWSDL references to concepts within domain ontologies which are stored in an ad-hoc repository. SAscha is provided as a Rich Internet Application (RIA) so as to be deployed as an infrastructural service itself for immediate use, without any need to resort to potentially complex client applications.

AB  - The recent EU enlargement opens up new opportunities, but poses new issues to be addressed. In particular, in order to enable and support cooperation between firms from different countries, it is necessary to address interoperability issues. The LD-CAST project aims at enabling cross border cooperation between European chambers of commerce (CCs) for supporting the development of private company initiatives. The project objective is to build a European network of portals that will enable end users (mainly private companies) to access in a seamless mode services provided by public organizations registered in each portal. This paper briefly presents a cooperation framework for semantic interoperability mainly based on the following semantic technologies: ontology management, semantic annotation, and semantic search and discovery. Finally the business ontology produced in the course of the project is presented.

AB  - Effective data sharing, across government agencies and other organisations, relies upon agreed meanings and representations. A key, technological challenge in electronic governance is to ensure that the meaning of data items is accurately recorded, and accessible in an economical-effectively, automatic - fashion. In response, a variety of data and metadata standards have been put forward: from government departments, from industry groups, and from organisations such as the ISO and W3C. This paper shows how the leading standard for metadata registration - ISO 11179 - can be deployed without the need for a single, monolithic conceptualisation of the domain, and hence without the need for universal agreement upon a particular model of electronic governance. The advantages of this approach are discussed with regard to the UK eGovern-ment Interoperability Framework (eGIF) and the UK Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV). Copyright 2008 ACM.

AB  - A use case is developed for semantic interoperability in the local government licensing process. Issues with current licence management systems are also considered. A system is then developed to meet the use case requirements. Development utilises the UK's Digital National Framework, "an industry standard for integrating and sharing business and geographic information from multiple sources" [1] and the standards and tools of the semantic web. A high level licensing process ontology is developed, while others are built representing specific licensing legislation. A licence management system is built which uses these ontologies in linking licence applications, including spatial information, to their legal framework. This allows engagement by licensing stakeholders who hold differing perspectives and understandings of the process and core objects.

AB  - Ontologies have been investigated for a while and are being studied as an instrument to enable cross-organizational semantic interoperability. The project BRITE (Business Register Interoperability Throughout Europe) aims at exploring ontologies as an instrument to effectively enable European Business Registers (BRs) to respond to changes imposed on them by European Union laws and new market requirements. In BRITE, ontologies are seen as a key instrument and technology to dissolve administrative, technical, cultural and lingual barriers of BRs on one hand, and as means to provide semantic interoperability on the other hand. The paper shows various ontology components of BRITE. It defines the inter-relation among these components and focuses on the domain ontology functionalities. We conclude with a critical reflection and valuable lessons learnt. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The search for effective strategies to increase the transparency in public administration processes is becoming a key issue for governments and for the success of the new citizen-centric services and applications. Also, the application of service-oriented architectures, semantics and ontologies is gaining momentum as an alternative to fulfill the inherent e-Government interoperability and dynamism demands. Considering the challenges introduced by this new scenario, this paper contributes proposing an approach to monitor and audit composite e-Government services. The solution is based on a set of Traceability Policies modeled and implemented over a semantically-enriched and service-oriented middleware (CoGPlat).

AB  - The desideratum of semantic interoperability has been intensively discussed in medical informatics circles in recent years. Originally, experts assumed that this issue could be sufficiently addressed by insisting simply on the application of shared clinical terminologies or clinical information models. However, the use of the term 'ontology' has been steadily increasing more recently. We discuss criteria for distinguishing clinical ontologies from clinical terminologies and information models. Then, we briefly present the role clinical ontologies play in two multicentric research projects. Finally, we discuss the interactions between these different kinds of knowledge representation artifacts and the stakeholders involved in developing interoperational real-world clinical applications. We provide ontology engineering examples from two EU-funded projects. © J.UCS.

AB  - Semantic Web technology is able to provide the required computational semantics for interoperability of learning resources across different Learning Management Systems (LMS) and Learning Object Repositories (LOR). The EU research project LUISA (Learning Content Management System Using Innovative Semantic Web Services Architecture) addresses the development of a reference semantic architecture for the major challenges in the search, interchange and delivery of learning objects in a service-oriented context. One of the key issues, highlighted in this paper, is Digital Rights Management (DRM) interoperability. A Semantic Web approach to copyright management has been followed, which places a Copyright Ontology as the key component for interoperability among existing DRM systems and other licensing schemes like Creative Commons. Moreover, Semantic Web tools like reasoners, rule engines and semantic queries facilitate the implementation of an interoperable copyright management component in the LUISA architecture. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - During the last decades eGovernment has been a vivid, dynamic research and development area. As services are being transformed, electronic documents and web services appear every day in many countries, the involved stakeholders are in urgent need for an instrument to structure governmental administration processes, service composition and provision - in a way that eGovernment transformation can be constantly managed. This paper presents the creation of an eGovernment ontology, and the development of a knowledge-based registry of governmental services in Greece. This Registry is an advanced web portal, devoted to the formal description, composition and publishing of traditional, electronic and web services, including the relevant electronic documents, information systems and as well the process descriptions and the work-flow models in an integrated knowledge base. Through such a repository, the discovery of services by users or systems has been automated, resulting in an important tool for achieving interoperable eGovernment transformation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.

AB  - The paper presents an example of e-government service integration on a semantic basis, as it was designed within the Access-eGov research project and applied in the Schleswig-Holstein state government. The case study follows up the application of a requirements-driven approach for designing e-government service interfaces with respect to the informational needs of citizens and business users. Using this approach, a conceptual model for e-government services was developed, formalised in the WSML ontology language, and used for semantic annotation of the services as a basis for integration. A subsequent field test was focused on the evaluation of produced semantic description on the client-side system components as Annotation tool and the Personal Assistant Client. The results of the field test have been evaluated and are presented in as lessons learned. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2008.

AB  - Repeatability is one of the most fundamental components of any methodology or framework in any engineering discipline. Many research projects attempting to formulate some modelling strategies as the new technologies and development techniques are being proposed in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) domain. In absence of a documented best common practice of design and modelling techniques for e-service composition, it would be greatly beneficial to discover such common practices and describe the detail specifications of a repeatable methodology for e-service composition projects. This paper will discuss some proposed e-government integration models, and then it will introduce some e-service integration practices and classifications of e-service composition strategies. The main contribution of this paper is to propose detailed specifications of a repeatable methodology for e-service composition projects. This methodology called E-service Integration Methodology (E-SIM) is a repeatable process, clearly defining all the tasks and activities of its process to provide effective management control over all these tasks and activities. This paper also will use E-SIM to model a simplified e-service integration solution as a proof of concept. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Nowadays, there is a growing number of e-government portals and solutions that provide integrated governmental e-services to the customers (citizens, enterprises or other public sectors). However, the administration and interoperability of distributed e-government nodes are faced with increasing challenges caused by the service-oriented modeling difficulties and ontological issues in distributed computing, resource integration and knowledge sharing over heterogeneous computing platforms. To overcome this, a Semantic Grid infrastructure is presented in this paper for distributed management of e-government resources across ubiquitous virtual governmental agencies. An ontology-based service-oriented approach to problem-solving in e-government is proposed in the Semantic Grid, enabling to provide, in an open, dynamic, loosely coupled and scalable manner, the service publication, discovery and reuse for connecting the customers and agencies of e-government services based on their semantic similarities in terms of problem-solving capabilities. The operation of the system is demonstrated using Protégé-2000, a widely accepted ontology modeling tool to validate the implementation of the proposed approach towards effective ontological maintenance.

AB  - The increasing volume of eGovernment-related services is demanding new approaches for service integration and interoperability in this domain. Semantic Web technologies and applications can leverage the potential of eGovernment service integration and discovery, facing the problems of semantic heterogeneity of eGovernment information sources and the different levels of interoperability. In line with this, eGovernment services will be semantically described in the foreseeable future. In an environment with semantically- annotated services, software agents are essential as the entities responsible for exploiting the semantic content in order to automate some tasks thus improving the user experience. In this paper, we first present SEMMAS, an ontology-based Multi-Agent framework for seamlessly integrating Intelligent Agents and Semantic Web Services. The proposed framework is independent from both the application and the domain. Our approach is backed with a proof-of-concept implementation where the breakthrough of integrating disparate eGovernment services has been tested. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Data heterogeneity in the public sector is a serious problem and remains to be a key issue as different naming conventions are used to represent similar data labels. The e-government effort in many countries has provided a platform for government entities and their business partners to exchange data through Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and standards such as RosettaNet (B2B data exchange standard), EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport), XML (Extensible Markup Language) and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). However, e-government efforts have not really resolved data heterogeneity problems significantly due to limitation of these standards. One such limitation is the inability of data inheritance. In order to solve this problem with emphasis on Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web Services, a semantically enriched web service for the public sector is needed. Thus we propose an ontology-based solution which allows data inheritance and polymorphism. This goal of this paper is to show how heterogeneous e-government documents can be semantically matched. We propose a shared hierarchical knowledge repository approach and a detailed process methodology for semantic mediation. A two-part semantic mediation approach using SRS (Semantic Relatedness Scores) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is highlighted. Both measures are complimentary and provide the semantics necessary for resolving schema heterogeneity. Our approach incorporates a rule-based engine that reads and executes SWRL rules (i.e. RacerPro). We also adopted several tools for proof-of-concept such as Protege (i.e. ontology editor) and JESS (Java Expert Shell System). © 2008 Universidad de Talca-Chile.

AB  - In the effort of Governments worldwide to effectively transform manual into electronic services, semantic interoperability issues pose as a key challenge: system-to-system interaction asks for standardized data definitions, codification of existing unstructured information and a framework for managing governmental data in a unified way. Integrating and extending recent developments in Germany, Hong-Kong, UK and US governments - but also eBusiness interoperability research results in Europe, the proposed approach is applied within the Greek e-Government Framework and bears the following steps: (a) Gathering and analysis of governmental service forms at field level, so that common structures can be identified, (b) Customization of UN/CEFACT Core Components, (c) Semiautomatic XML Schema Definition (XSD) files creation, using sets of naming, structuring and verification rules, (d) Adoption of international or development of country-specific Codelists, (e) Development of guidance material for the application of the approach by government officials at central or local level. Discussion on the results is targeting best practice examples that can be drawn at scientific and organizational level, but also the key difficulties that have to be tackled - in relevance with the administrations and industry readiness in each country. Future steps include enhancing the paradigm in order to cover vertical data standards and applying the approach to other EU or associated countries. © Universidad de Talca.

AB  - This article proposes a multi-agent based framework that allows multiple data sources and models to be semantically integrated for spatial modeling in business processing. The paper reviews the feasibility of ontology-based spatial resource integration options to combine the core spatial reasoning with domain-specific application models. We propose an ontology-based framework for semantic level communication of spatial objects and application models. We then introduce a multi-agent system, ontology-based spatial information and resource integration services (OSIRIS), to semantically interoperate complex spatial services and integrate them in a meaningful composition. The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. We also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS. Copyright © 2008, IGI Global.

AB  - The US Army Medical Research & Materiel Command (USAMRMC) Telemedicine & Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) convened an Integrated Research Team (IRT) on HealthGrid: Grid Technologies for Biomedicine on 1-2 March, 2006. The proceedings and conclusions from this meeting are presented in the following report. This paper was prepared with the involvement of leading biomedical researchers, computer scientists, engineers, and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) experts. The purpose of this document is to provide a research roadmap towards "Net-Centric Healthcare", 1 all the while reconciling with future USAMRMC priorities. In an effort to produce tools that enable/enhance research, education, and direct patient care under the umbrella of the Department of Defense Tricare System, this report concludes with a call for TATRC (and others) to enable Grid technologies via applied research programs for the Military Healthcare Service (MHS). This document serves to communicate expectations and requirements to all parties - end users, policymakers, scientists, as well as technology leaders. The roadmap provides a foundation upon which TATRC may organize its strategic priorities and commit to resource allocations. HealthGrids are computational environments of shared resources in which heterogeneous and dispersed biomedical data is accessed, mined and computed. Advances in computer science allow biomedical researchers to capitalize on ubiquitous & transparent distributed systems and a broad set of tools for resource sharing (computation, storage, data, replication, security, semantic interoperability, and delivery of software as services). The foremost opportunity of the HealthGrid is the creation of a research climate that transforms the biomedical sector into a functional knowledge society, as the contemporary equivalent of the original Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)2 transformed networks to become today's Internet. To synthesize a roadmap from the expertise of the IRT participants, four break-out groups were convened to delineate milestones and estimate requirements necessary to overcome current implementation barriers. A mix of academic, industry and government subject matter experts addressed both technological and socio-political dynamics. The HealthGrid was catalogued into four discrete functions which interoperate: Computation Grids, Data Grids, Knowledge Grids, and Collaboration Grids. The breakout groups mirrored this taxonomy. Systems Medicine provided a framework for the HealthGrid IRT and resultant research roadmap. Contributors worked off the predicate that 'functions of life are mediated by biological networks, and human disease occurs when one or more of these networks become perturbed by genetic mutations and/or abnormal environmental signals'. Systems Medicine is driving development of new in-vivo and in-vitro measurement technologies, which, collectively, in the next 5-20 years, will lead to medical care that is predictive, preventative, personalized and participatory (P4 medicine).4 Grid technologies provide a powerful technology infrastructure and enabler to attain this goal. Derivatively, the HealthGrid aims to foster innovation in how disease is viewed, diagnosed, treated, and prevented. This decade is witness to major revolutions in our comprehension of the human genome, infectious disease, environmental influences, cancer and aging. The advent of electronic health records in combination with Grid technologies and growing interdisciplinary collaborations present the opportunity to participate in new scientific and medical breakthroughs at an ever-accelerating pace, emblematic of our transformation to a 'knowledge society'. This report attempts to refine the broad landscape of the HealthGrid into scalable and 'digestable' targets of opportunity. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Resources devoted to eGovernment make it possible the soaring amount of solutions and projects available nowadays. These projects take place in administrations from different levels and provide solutions that are not driven by a common infrastructure. Main shortcomings due to these phenomena are related to lacks of interoperability and difficulties for locating desired services. As a result, the digital gap may get bigger. To overcome these drawbacks, a semantic approach based on LifeEvents, a concept presented in the paper, is proposed. By means of LifeEvents, an interoperable manner to address needs from the point of view of the citizen is developed. As they are described using OWL, powerful semantic resources are available. A process of analysis in the domain has been conducted and this turns out in a powerful ontology that may support the characterization of Life Events. The goal is to allow not only already defined LifeEvents but also those identified in the future. Even more, once LifeEvents are defined by means of an ontology, they are susceptible of being published under the form of Semantic Web Services. Thus, it is possible to enable enhancements about composition, discovery and organization, as shown in the paper, within the framework of this proposal.

AB  - The natural evolution of eGovernment is to go beyond the management of identities and therefore it is necessary to manage people, companies or organizations, and their capabilities to interact with Public Administrations. When developing an application based on an eID management system, this management issue must be tackled within each application (i.e. demonstrate the capability of one person to act, demonstrate the economical reliability, demonstrate his professional status, etc⋯) and is normally based on the local jurisdiction. The objective of the present paper is to introduce a distributed system for the privacy-enhanced management of the capabilities associated to a person within the EU framework, independently from the origin and destination EU member state. The core of this system is the intelligence of the Capabilities Resolution Nodes (CRN) to cope with the complexity of the capability resolution and the capability sources discovery in the pan-European scenario. A European Capacity Resolution Network will be able to grow up the interoperability of the digital identities provided and valid in each member state and will answer the question "is this person, identified with this digital identity and who is described by those attributes, allowed to carry out this legal act in this country according to its law?".

AB  - The eGovernment is a field of applications for the Semantic Web. The eGovernment also is becoming an important research area and faces considerable challenges to achieve interoperability because of the semantic differences of interpretation, complexity and width of scope. It is however an open question how to apply these techniques fruitfully in the eGovernment domain. This paper addresses the importance of providing a semantic application that, within the eGovernment domain, is capable of dealing with the issue of the retrieval of government documentation in a timely and accurate way. In this paper, we present an approach ontology-based for retrieving government information.

AB  - For the integration of data that resides in autonomous data sources Software AG uses ontologies. Data source ontologies describe the data sources themselves. Business ontologies provide an integrated view of the data. FLogic rules are used to describe mappings between data objects in data source or business ontologies. Furthermore, FLogic is used as the query language. FLogic rules are perfectly suited to describe the mappings between objects and their properties. Some of these mapping rules can be generated automatically from the data sources metadata. Some patterns do frequently reoccur in user-defined mapping rules, for instance rules which establish inverse object relations or rules which create new object relations based on the objects' property values. Within our first project access to information is still typical data retrieval and not so much knowledge inference. Therefore, a lot of effort in this project concentrated on query functionality and even more on performance. But these are only first steps. To strengthen this development and to get more experience in this field Software AG recently joined several EU research projects which all have a focus on exploitation of semantic technology with concrete business cases.

AB  - E-commerce on the internet provides a high level of flexibility and openness, but it still has many drawbacks due to the heterogeneity of the exchanged information. Web Services have added a new level of functionality on top of current Web, enabling the use and combination of distributed functional components within and across company boundaries, but they offer only syntactical description that are hardly amenable to automation. Developments in the field of Semantic Web Services (SWS) show the opportunity of adding higher semantic levels to the existing frameworks, to improve their usage and ease scalability. In this paper, we outline a Semantic Web e-commerce in which data sources and services are made available through SWS, described by ontologies, allowing interoperability as well as reasoning to create a comprehensive response adapted to user goals. We present a semantic web service oriented model for e-commerce, aiming to integrate the development of Semantic Web services using the WSMO into ISR-III framework, it can also be applied to e-government. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - One of the key problems in healthcare informatics is the inability to share patient records across enterprises. To address this problem, an important industry initiative called "integrating the healthcare enterprise (IHE)" specified the "cross enterprise document sharing (XDS)" profile. In the IHE XDS, healthcare enterprises that agree to work together form a "clinical affinity domain" and store healthcare documents in an ebXML registry/repository architecture to facilitate their sharing. The affinity domains also agree on a common set of policies such as coding lists to be used to annotate clinical documents in the registry/ repository and the common schemes for patient identification. However, since patients expect their records to follow them as theymove from one clinical affinity domain to another, there is a need for affinity domains to be federated to enable information exchange. In this paper, we describe how IHE XDS can be enhanced to support federated clinical affinity domains. We demonstrate that federation of affinity domains are facilitated when ontologies, rather than coding term lists, are used to annotate clinical documents. Furthermore, we describe a patient identification protocol that eliminates the need to keep a master patient index file for the federation. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Important time-saving benefits are possible in 3D geodata acquisition that involve main road traffic and industrial activity sites, if Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) employ noise mapping through different strategies, other than entirely centralized and decentralized options. These include the use of the existing state SDI structures where the centralized provision of statewide available in 3D geodata via SDI and the centralized processing of main road traffic. Total financial savings are estimated at 60% of the total costs. Also, remarkable savings of 50% sectoral costs can be made in the sector of main road traffic, if the road traffic geodata are centralized for all main roads and the environmental noise mapping is centrally processed for all main roads outside of the urban agglomerations. A quantification of the costs for geodata integration caused by the use of different data models, accuracies and techniques for the extraction of 3D geodata can be determined. However, there are problems relating to interoperability of syntactic and geometrical data. A solution for syntactic interoperability problems will be the use of Geography Markup Language (GML) as an interoperable geodata exchange format. The new extended CityGML modeling language for 3D geodata storage and exchange is useful for solving semantic interoperability problems.

AB  - For the integration of data that resides in autonomous data sources Software AG uses ontologies. Data source ontologies describe the data sources themselves. Business ontologies provide an integrated view of the data. FLogic rules are used to describe mappings between data objects in data source or business ontologies. Furthermore, FLogic is used as the query language. FLogic rules are perfectly suited to describe the mappings between objects and their properties. Some of these mapping rules can be generated automatically from the data sources metadata. Some patterns do frequently reoccur in user-defined mapping rules, for instance rules which establish inverse object relations or rules which create new object relations based on the objects' property values. Within our first project access to information is still typical data retrieval and not so much knowledge inference. Therefore, a lot of effort in this project concentrated on query functionality and even more on performance. But these are only first steps. To strengthen this development and to get more experience in this field Software AG recently joined several EU research projects which all have a focus on exploitation of semantic technology with concrete business cases. © 2007 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Service-oriented computing is a newly predominant factor in IT research and development. Web services appear to be the middleware solution of the future for highly interoperable distributed software solutions. In parallel, research on the Semantic Web provides the results required to exploit distributed machine-processable data. Organizations like W3C and the EU have begun a number of research projects to combine these research lines into industrial-strength applications. In Enabling Semantic Web Services, Dieter Fensel and his contributors offer a thorough, practical introduction to one of the most promising approaches - the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO). After a brief review of basic technologies and standards of the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and Web Services, they examine WSMO from the fundamentals to possible applications in e-commerce, e-government and e-banking; they also describe its relation to other approaches like OWL-S and WSDL-S. With many of the related technologies and standards still under development, this book offers an up-to-date conceptual introduction, plus pointers to future application scenarios for researchers in acad. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - Current fashion systems to interconnect large software architectures are moving toward SOA based solutions. This new paradigm for designing system can be improved, in our opinion, by using semantics. Semantics can a play a main role in boosting interoperability thanks to current technologies to express knowledge and to describe Semantic Web Services (SWS). This paper tackles the provision of a Software Architecture for eGovernment by means of LifeEvents, a semantic modeling tool to describe services in the domain deeply discussed in the paper. ©2008 IEEE.

AB  - We discuss our DLDB knowledge base system and evaluate its capability in processing a very large set of real-world Semantic Web data. Using DLDB, we have constructed the Hawkeye knowledge base, in which we have loaded more than 166 million facts from a diverse set of real-world data sources. We use this knowledge base to demonstrate realistic integration queries in egovernment and academic scenarios. In order to support Hawkeye, we extended DLDB with additional reasoning capabilities. At present, the Semantic Web consists of numerous independent ontologies. We demonstrate that OWL can be used to integrate these ontologies and thereby integrate the data sources that commit to them. In terms of performance, we show that the load time of our system is linear on the number of triples loaded. Furthermore, we show that many complex queries have response times under one minute, and that simple queries can be answered in seconds. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - In this paper, the research background is E-government virtual organization (EGVO). In order to provide users with the same interface for accessing to semantic data, and to realize knowledge share and reuse among various kinds of governmental resources, this paper brings ontology technology into EGVO information integration. Ontology solves the semantic heterogeneity problem of distributed, heterogeneous and autonomous data source; it can realize the semantic interoperability. However, the governmental objects in EGVO are highly dynamic and unpredictable. The information integration is changing along with the objects, thus the corresponding ontology also needs to be changed. This paper mainly discusses the changing process of dynamic ontology and the correlative methods. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we describe a powerful use case application in the area of emergency situations management in which to illustrate the benefits of a system based on Semantic Web Services (SWS), through the automation of the business processes involved. After creating Web services to provide spatial data to third parties through the Internet, semantics and domain ontologies were added to represent the business processes involved, allowing: ease of access and combination of heterogeneous data from different providers; and automatic discovery, access and composition to perform more complex tasks. In this way, our prototype contributes to better management of emergency situations by those responsible. The work described is supported by the DIP (Data, Information and Process Integration with Semantic Web Services) project.

AB  - The Electronic Government is an emerging field of applications for the Semantic Web where ontologies are becoming an important research technology. The e-Government faces considerable challenges to achieve interoperability given the semantic differences of interpretation, complexity and width of scope. This paper addresses the importance of providing an infrastructure capable of dealing with issues such as: communications between public administrations across government and retrieval of official and non official documents in a timely, secure and accurate way at the back office. A semantic peer-to-peer approach is proposed to enhance the information management at the e-Government domain; this approach is integrated with a Government Information Retrieval system and it reuses the EGO Model which can be deployed within the e-Government context.

AB  - Interoperable management and integration of all relevant project information is amongst the most critical issues for the success and further growth of the VO paradigm. In this paper we describe the design of an ontology framework for VOs that enables VO communication, information and process management on the basis of a common semantic vocabulary of concepts, coherently representing the data, the services, the actors, the business processes and the IT system itself. The paper presents the major components of the developed conceptual framework (core resource, service, organisational and business process ontologies), outlines the possibilities for domain extensions with specific focus on IFC, and provides a brief overview of the status of the implementation in the frames of the EU project InteliGrid (IST-004664, 2004-2007). Special emphasis is given to the explanation of major concepts modelled on the basis of the Web Ontology Language OWL and the interoperability of the developed modular ontology definitions. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This paper will suggest initiating a cross-domain dialogue, including lessons learned from another complex system-of-systems development, to (and from) the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS.) Much of the Joint Network Enabled Operations (NEO) development work for the future global aviation system is analogous to the ongoing development of the IOOS. Further, there have been important practical lessons on elements of advocacy, and related coalitions of stakeholders, which support successful outcomes. During 2005, an initial spiral development and demonstration project was conducted by a government and industry team applying a NEO, system-of-systems approach to develop the next generation aviation system. Like IOOS, this work was performed in support of an interagency customer set (in this case the Joint Planning and Development Office representing DOT/FAA, DoD, DHS, NASA, DOC/NOAA.) This project explored current and future operational concepts, architecture definition, information exchange requirements, data standards and protocols, and strategic and tactical-level decision support (with special emphasis on timely, data-driven collaborative decision making for complex operational problems.) The next spiral development project will be planned and executed in 2006 and 2007. An important area of early user engagement in the NEO development work was the exploration of a generalized data model to represent the data for a widely diverse future set of data suppliers and users. For the traditional air traffic domain of the baseline system, an important part of this is the Flight Data Object. For the diverse set of interagency and private sector users and for future aviation system concepts, this baseline was an inadequate data representation. Similarly, the NEO project systems engineering and test bed development is related to ongoing work in standards and protocols (including semantics, data structures) for the IOOS. ©2006 IEEE.

AB  - Research on data integration has provided a set of rich and well understood schema mediation languages and systems that provide a meta-data representation of the modeled real world, while, in general, they do not deal with data instances. Such meta-data are necessary for querying classes result of an integration process: the end user typically does not know the contents of such classes, he simply defines his queries on the basis of the names of classes and attributes. In this paper we introduce an approach enriching the description of selected attributes specifying as meta-data a list of the "relevant values" for such attributes. Furthermore relevant values may be hierarchically collected in a taxonomy. In this way, the user may exploit new meta-data in the interactive process of creating/refining a query. The same meta-data are also exploited by the system in the query rewriting/unfolding process in order to filter the results showed to the user. We conducted an evaluation of the strategy in an e-business context within the EU-IST SEWASIE project. The evaluation proved the practicability of the approach for large value instances. © 2010.

AB  - For the integration of data that resides in autonomous data sources Software AG uses ontologies. Data source ontologies describe the data sources themselves. Business ontologies provide an integrated view of the data. F-Logic rules are used to describe mappings between data objects in data source or business ontologies. Furthermore, F-Logic is used as the query language. F-Logic rules are perfectly suited to describe the mappings between objects and their properties. Some of these mapping rules can be generated automatically from the data sources meta data. Some patterns do frequently reoccur in userdefined mapping rules, for instance rules which establish inverse object relations or rules which create new object relations based on the objects ' property values. Within our first project access to information is still typical data retrieval and not so much knowledge inference. Therefore, a lot of effort in this project concentrated on query functionality and even more on performance. But these are only first steps. To strengthen this development and to get more experience in this field Software AG recently joined several EU research projects which all have a focus on exploitation of semantic technology with concrete business cases. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Service integration and domain interoperability are the basic requirements in the development of current service-oriented e-Government applications. Semantic Web and, in particular, Semantic Web Service (SWS) technology aim to address these issues. However, the integration between e-Government applications and SWS is not an easy task. We argue that a more complex semantic layer needs to be modeled. The aim of our work is to provide an ontological framework that maps such a semantic layer. In this paper, we describe our approach for creating a project-independent and reusable model, and provide a case study that demonstrates its applicability.

AB  - The growing technological development, the accelerated devices convergence process and the increasing possibilities for interaction and communication, which are characteristics of 21st century, are introducing changes in all society's instances. In such mediated, networked context, an area that presents considerable development degrees in recent years and uncountable social-cultural, technological challenges is the institutionalization of information processes and/or services in government portals. From this perspective, the present work proposes CAfe-G (Common Architecture for e-Government), a comprehensive web-based framework meant to support interoperability among e-government systems, in order to improve the interaction levels of services provided by governments for their citizens (G2C), to support interaction among different governments (G2G), to assist citizens' requests for government services (C2G), and to enhance the relationship among citizens (C2C). Adaptation concerns are also addressed to support effective CzRM (Citizen Relationship Management). The proposed architecture consists in a bus of services and facilities designed to provide a high level of interoperability through a semantic-driven, upper ontologies-based mechanism for publishing and retrieving of such services and facilities. This approach is aimed to provide virtual spaces and communities for major participation of citizens, thus supplying services integration in order to boost the information exchange among different systems. CAfe-G is CORBA-inspired and it was built over concepts brought from AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and FOP (Feature-Oriented Programming). CAfe-G presents a feature set to represent Services related to Semantic, Life Events-Driven Presentation or pertinent to Facilities like Mobile, iDTV (Interactive Digital Television) and Trading Services. CAfe-G would help to reduce the bureaucracy, increase the transparency in governmental actions, intensify citizens' digital inclusion, and speed the use of technology up in governmental agencies, through the information interoperability among countries, governments and citizens.

AB  - The Electronic Government is a new field of applications for the semantic web where ontologies are becoming an important research technology. The e-Govemment faces considerable challenges to achieve interoperability given the semantic differences of interpretation, complexity and width of scope. In this paper we present the results obtained in an ongoing project commissioned by the Spanish government that seeks strategies for the e-Govemment to reduce the problems encountered when delivering services to citizens. We also introduce an e-Govemment ontology model; within this model a set of legal ontologies are devoted to representing the Real-estate transaction domain used to illustrate this paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - E-government is gaining momentum and has firmly established itself in addition to common terms such as 'e-commerce' or 'e-business'. Given that e-government services extend across different organisational boundaries and heterogeneous infrastructures, there is a critical need to manage the knowledge and information resources stored in these disparate systems. Semantic Web technologies have the potential to manage the knowledge and coordinate Government-to-Government (G2G) processes. Based on the foundations of Semantic Web, including ontologies, knowledge representation, multi-agent systems and web services; Knowledge Management (KM) and G2G processes, we present a vision for KM for G2G process coordination. The Semantic G2G integration can support the transparent flow of semantically enriched information and knowledge, including content and know-how and enable collaborative G2G processes within and across governmental agencies.

AB  - Much attention has been paid by government agencies and GIS researchers to standardization of data and interoperability of systems. Many of these efforts, however, have focused narrowly on technical hurdles while ignoring the social and political contexts that influence interoperability decisions. This article illustrates how social factors influence interoperability along three axes: classification, ontologies of data models, and government policy. Extant research approaches to interoperability of GIS are discussed and their strengths and weaknesses assessed. The article begins with definitions of what interoperability is, why it is important to academic users and policy makers, and its influence on geographical knowledge in a digital age. Exploration of social influences, as an alternative analytical approach to interoperability, begins with a discussion of the roles of classification and scale. The dangers of maintaining inflexible ontologies associated with specific data models are illustrated as a technical limitation with profound social implications for the construction of knowledge. Finally, policy at the multiple levels of governance with respect to interoperability is explored as an infrastructural constraint - and a diminishing influence.

AB  - The engineers of the industrial age created the transportation, water, power and other grids that provide the infrastructure of the civilized world. On the internet a new kind of grids are being set up - ones that are pulling together computing and communication resources to provide infrastructure for the digital economy. Civil engineers too can make use of this new paradigm of computing, not only to crunch through complex simulations but to use it as a collaboration platform for their virtual enterprise (VO) that is involved in the design, construction and management of products. This paper introduces the concept of grid computing, identifies the role grids could play in engineering processes, presents a high level architecture for grids based engineering services and tools, reviews it and defines the research and development issues. It is based on the results of an on-going European Union project InteliGrid - Interoperability of Virtual Organizations on a Complex Semantic Grid.

AB  - The ebXML registry has become one of the most well accepted registry standards for governments and industries. Though originally designed for B2B artifacts, almost any industrial artifact can be registered into an ebXML registry by extending the ebXML registry information model. However, this extensibility also debilitates its interoperability caused by insufficient semantic provided for it. This paper presents our solution to extend semantic for a software component in our development of SCRR system. An attribute ontology of software component is introduced to provide rich semantic information. We also explain how to implement a software component registry based on classification by applying the attribute ontology. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - We propose a composability model to ascertain that Web services can safely be combined, hence avoiding unexpected failures at runtime. Composability is checked through a set of rules organized into four levels: syntactic, static semantic, dynamic semantic, and qualitative levels. We introduce the concepts of composability degree and τ-composability to cater for partial and total composability. We also propose a set of algorithms for checking composability. Finally, we conduct a performance study (analytical and experimental) of the proposed algorithms. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - The composition of heterogeneous web services is a key aspect of usability and applicability of web services in different application domains such as business applications, healthcare, and e-government. Current research has developed different techniques to achieve effective composition of web services. Unfortunately, they fail to ensure a perfect match in the composition of web services. This paper investigates the composition of web services and how to effectively employ web services in the design activities. Objectives of this work are twofold. Firstly, to proposes a new technique that assists users to resolve a mismatch in the composition of web services. Secondly, to implement, validate, and evaluate the proposed technique within the context of design activities thus establishing a workbench called Service Oriented Design Activities (SODA). SODA provides a web-based design infrastructure that allows loosely coupled design teams to collaborate on different services, and to enable them to resolve any mismatch between heterogeneous design services. Other anticipated advantages include interoperability of design services, improving designer capabilities, and the reduction of product development time. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Semantics is seen as the key ingredient in the next phase of the Web infrastructure as well as the next generation of enterprise content management. Ontology is the centerpiece of the most prevalent semantic technologies and provides the basis of representing, acquiring, and utilizing knowledge. With the availability of several commercial products and many research tools, specifications and increasing adoption of Semantic Web standards such as RDF for metadata and OWL for ontology representation, ontology-driven techniques and systems have already enabled a new generation of industry strength semantic applications. In particular, Semagix's Freedom has powered applications in leading verticals such as, financial services, government & intelligence, pharmaceuticals, and media & entertainment. In this paper, we portray some of the requirements of high-end enterprise applications requiring search to integration, and more advanced analytical capabilities, discuss the enterprise scale capabilities expected of a semantic technology, and how Semagix has put an ontology-driven approach to use. © 2005 Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings

AB  - Due to the quantity and the diversity involved in e-government presentations and operations, traditional approaches to web site information management have been found to be rather inefficient in time and cost. Consequently, the necessity of establishing a government knowledge management system, so as to speed up information lookups, sharing, and linkups, naturally arises. Moreover, this knowledge management system would in turn enhance e-government effectiveness as it helps to store and transmit information, be it explicit or implicit in nature. The first step in creating this knowledge management system is to build up the government ontology and thesaurus. Upon the completion of the ontology and thesaurus needed, semantic searching can be conducted, which in turn kickstarts other mechanisms required for effective information management. Our research team has been commissioned by the Executive Yuan of Taiwan to establish the draft of government ontology and thesaurus and to design a framework for multiple-layered information management systems upon which the ontology and thesaurus can be constructed. The goal of this paper is to present the government ontology and thesaurus which our research team has come up with as well as the related infrastructure and function of the multiple-layered information management system © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - Security is considered as a major driver for the success of E-Business, especially in a business-to-business environment. Current research activities in this area are conducted in European Union funded research projects, such as TrustCoM putting an emphasis on the collaborative aspects of business processes across administrative and trust domains. With respect to the tendency of business partners to set up their own security islands, e.g. based on isolated Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), this development introduces a contradiction for collaborative business process. Clearly expressed process related security requirements across domains can not be met by domain specific security infrastructures. This contribution explores the possibility to bridge the identified gap using semantic relationships contributed by ontologies. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper we describe an application of the lexical resource surWordNet and of the Core Legal Ontology as a descriptive vocabulary for modeling legal domains. It can be viewed as the semantic component of a global standardisation framework for digital governments. A content description model provides a repository of structured knowledge aimed at supporting the semantic interoperability between sectors of Public Administration and the communication processes towards citizen. Specific conceptual models built from this base will act as a cognitive interface able to cope with specific digital government issues and to improve the interaction between citizen and Public Bodies. As a Case study, the representation of the click-on licences for re-using Public Sector Information is presented. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - In this paper the conceptualization and design of an ICT framework is proposed and discussed - an intelligent framework for supporting organizational networking and the effective sharing of resources. The challenges for this are to: (i) provide a comfortable and "easy to use"but effective knowledge brokering environment, (ii) used within a decision supported flexible and highly dynamic collaboration platform, and (iii) supplemented with add-ons to fulfil security and privacy requirements. These objectives are 'achieved by developing software components consisting of: (i) an ontology based and decision supported knowledge management structures applicable to different entities, and (ii) an interoperability environment realized as a dynamic and reconfigurable platform using semantic web services and multi agent systems, (iii) supplemented with semantic web service and agent related privacy and security modules. The framework mirrors the modern and future oriented way of ubiquitous computing, where computers will be relegated to the background of our lives and everybody may be at the same time client, broker and, provider of services.

AB  - The information available in languages other than English in the World Wide Web is increasing significantly. According to a report from Computer Economics in 1999, 54% of Internet users are English speakers ("English Will Dominate Web for Only Three More Years," Computer Economics, July 9, 1999, http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html). However, it is predicted that there will be only 60% increase in Internet users among English speakers verses a 150% growth among non-English speakers for the next five years. By 2005, 57% of Internet users will be non-English speakers. A report by CNN.com in 2000 showed that the number of Internet users in China had been increased from 8.9 million to 16.9 million from January to June in 2000 ("Report: China Internet users double to 17 million," CNN.com, July, 2000, http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.html). According to Nielsen/NetRatings, there was a dramatic leap from 22.5 millions to 56.6 millions Internet users from 2001 to 2002. China had become the second largest global at-home Internet population in 2002 (US's Internet population was 166 millions) (Robyn Greenspan, "China Pulls Ahead of Japan," Internet.com, April 22, 2002, http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,,5911_1013841,0 0.html). All of the evidences reveal the importance of crosslingual research to satisfy the needs in the near future. Digital library research has been focusing in structural and semantic interoperability in the past. Searching and retrieving objects across variations in protocols, formats and disciplines are widely explored (Schatz, B., & Chen, H. (1999). Digital libraries: technological advances and social impacts. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, February, 32(2), 45-50.; Chen, H., Yen, J., & Yang, C.C. (1999). International activities: development of Asian digital libraries. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, 32(2), 48-49). However, research in crossing language boundaries, especially across European languages and Oriental languages, is still in the initial stage. In this proposal, we put our focus on cross-lingual semantic interoperability by developing automatic generation of a cross-lingual thesaurus based on English/Chinese parallel corpus. When the searchers encounter retrieval problems, professional librarians usually consult the thesaurus to identify other relevant vocabularies. In the problem of searching across language boundaries, a cross-lingual thesaurus, which is generated by co-occurrence analysis and Hopfield network, can be used to generate additional semantically relevant terms that cannot be obtained from dictionary. In particular, the automatically generated cross-lingual thesaurus is able to capture the unknown words that do not exist in a dictionary, such as names of persons, organizations, and events. Due to Hong Kong's unique history background, both English and Chinese are used as official languages in all legal documents. Therefore, English/Chinese cross-lingual information retrieval is critical for applications in courts and the government. In this paper, we develop an automatic thesaurus by the Hopfield network based on a parallel corpus collected from the Web site of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Experiments are conducted to measure the precision and recall of the automatic generated English/Chinese thesaurus. The result shows that such thesaurus is a promising tool to retrieve relevant terms, especially in the language that is not the same as the input term. The direct translation of the input term can also be retrieved in most of the cases.

AB  - The recent past If we look at the past, in the last decade many activities, at European level and world-wide, have contributed to substantially advance knowledge and capability of how to represent, create, maintain, acquire, access, tune, etc. large lexical repositories. These repositories are rich in linguistic knowledge (and often in world knowledge), and many are based on best practices and standards that have been consensuali}' agreed on or have been submitted to the international community as de facto standards. Core -or even large - lexical repositories have been and are being built for many European (and non EU) languages. Many came into existence in European projects, and continued in National Projects (see http://www.enabler-network.org/index.htm), thus creating the necessary platform for a future European lexical infrastructure. A vision for the next future Looking at the future, a further step and radical change of perspective is now needed in order to facilitate the integration of the linguistic information resulting from all these initiatives, to bridge the differences between various perspectives on language structure and linguistic content, to put an infrastructure into place for content description and content interoperability at European level and beyond, and to make lexical resources usable within the emerging Semantic Web scenario. This objective can only be achieved when working in the direction of an integrated Open and Distributed Lexical Infrastructure, based on open content interoperability standards, where not only the linguistic experts can participate, but which includes designers, developers and users of content encoding practices, and also many members of the society. The new proposed paradigm of an Open Lexical Infrastructure requires new approaches at various levels. The effort of making available millions of 'words' for dozens of languages is something that no individual or small group is able to afford. It is already proved by a number of projects mat lexicon building and maintenance can be achieved in a cooperative way. We claim that the field of computational lexicons is mature enough to broaden and open the concept of cooperative effort to a much larger set of communities, so that lexicon creation, updating and maintenance will be no longer only a lexicographers' task, but will involve broad groups of experts, and - why not? - also 'non-experts' and the general public. Critical issues for the new paradigm The approach to realise such a lexical infrastructure requires the coverage not only of a range of aspects pertaining to linguistic modelling, but also - and maybe most critically - of a number of organisational aspects. Moreover, such a lexical infrastructure is inherently market driven, since the most widely used lexical portions will be the best developed and supported A few keywords /desiderata for an Open Lexical Infrastructure are: open framework, multilingual, multimodal, multimedial, dynamic, integrative, knowledge intensive, consensual, interactive. Lexicons integration and interoperability The model of open data categories will foster language resources integration and interoperability, through links to common standards. With the ISLE (http://lingue.ilc.cnr.it/EAGLES96/isle/ISLE-Honie-Page.htm) approach to lexical standards, and its definition of the MILE (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry), new lexical objects can be progressively created and linked to the core set. We foresee an increasing number of well-defined linguistic data categories and lexical objects stored in open and standardised repositories which will be used by different types of users to define their own structures within an open lexical framework. It is this re-usage of shared linguistic objects which will link new contents to the already existing lexical objects, while enabling shareability of distributed lexicon portions. The design of an abstract model of lexicon architecture will ensure a flexible model while working with a core set of lexical data categories. It will guarantee freedom for the user to add or change objects if that is deemed necessary, will provide an evaluation protocol for the core standard lexical data categories, and will require verification methods for the integration of new objects From static to dynamic lexicons The promotion of a change of perspective on lexicons as static resources towards dynamic entities, whose content is co-determined by automatically acquired linguistic information from text corpora and from the web. is deemed essential. We stress the need of using (semi-)automatic or machine-aided methods wherever possible in LR work. Semantic Web initiatives are also focussing on the building" of ontologica! representations from texts, and in this respect show a large amount of conceptual overlap with the notion of a dynamic lexicon. In automating the information extraction process, lexical resources are one fundamental piece, and acquisition may require cycles of adjustments in the lexical modelling. The acquisition tools must be able to increase the repository with new words/terms, possibly their definitions, domain, etc., from digital material, to learn concepts from text - including automatic multilingual thesaurus building, and to tailor resources to specific needs. This implies, for the machine learning community, developing new and stronger algorithmic methodologies to model textual statistics, and integrating them with traditional NLP tools. Agents will look for examples, identify uses in monolingual/multilingual web texts for glossary creation. This will ensure also virtual links between lexicons and examples (corpus/web samples, image samples, clips and videos, etc.), pushing towards new and innovative types of lexicons, i.e. a sort of 'example based living lexicons', linguistic objects that participate of properties of both lexicons and corpora. A cooperative model This vision, enabled by MILE, will pave the way to the realisation of a common platform for interoperability between different fields of linguistic activity - such as lexicology, lexicography, terminology - and Semantic Web development. The platform will provide a flexible common environment not only for linguists, terminologists and ontologists, but also for content providers and content management software vendors.- The lexicons may be distributed, i.e. different building blocks may reside at different locations on the web and are linked by URLs. This is strictly related to the Semantic Web standards (with RDF metadata to describe lexicon data categories), and will enable users to share lexicons and collaborate on parts of them. Overall, the lexicons will perform the bridging function between documents and conceptual categorisation. The descriptive framework and the tools will be tailored to the needs of the creation of both general vocabularies and temiinological repositories for different worlds and domains. The common conceptual model within the envisaged architecture will ensure content interoperability between texts, multimodal documents, lexicons and ontologies. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - Semantic standardization is an integral part of sharing data for GIS and spatial analysis. It is part of a broader rubric of interoperability or the ability to share geographic information across multiple platforms and contexts. GIScience researchers have made considerable progress towards understanding and addressing the multiple challenges involved in achieving interoperability. For local government agencies interested in sharing spatial data, however, current interoperability approaches based on object-oriented data models represent idealistic solutions to problems of semantic heterogeneity that often exceed the level of sophistication and funding available. They are waiting for the market to decide how interoperability should be resolved. In order to assist in this transition, this paper presents a rule-based Visual Basic application to standardize the semantics of simple spatial entities using several classification systems. We use the example of well-log data, and argue that this approach enables agencies to share and structure data effectively in an interim period during which market and research standards for semantic interoperability are being determined. It contributes to a geospatial data infrastructure, while allowing agencies to share spatial data in a manner consistent with their level of expertise and existing data structures.
