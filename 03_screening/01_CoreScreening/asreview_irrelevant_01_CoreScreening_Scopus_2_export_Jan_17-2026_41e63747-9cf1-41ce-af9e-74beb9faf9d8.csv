Metadata quality and management are key aspects in this regard; in their absence affecting the interoperability, findability, and consequently, open data consumption. The present study aims to analyse several semantic aspects of 3 major international data portals and their metadata schemas mapped to the main DCAT schema classes in order to assess the current status regarding metadata provision and aiming towards prospective standardisation and improved semantic interoperability of the datasets available. The analysis revealed several persisting challenges, including the lack of standardised information (e.g., controlled vocabularies) as accepted values of the identified mandatory metadata fields in use, or, in the case of existing standardisation schemas, a misalignment and lack of consensus among the different portals. The study also pinpoints future research lines centred around the elicitation of guidelines and practices to standardise not only descriptive but also domain-specific metadata provision across the portals, facilitating the process towards the identification of minimum sets of metadata descriptions applicable to various contexts, and reaching one step closer to the envisioned interoperable ODPs paradigm. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,147-157,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Semantic Web technologies and applications can leverage the potential of eGovernment service integration and discovery, facing the problems of semantic heterogeneity of eGovernment information sources and the different levels of interoperability. In line with this, eGovernment services will be semantically described in the foreseeable future. In an environment with semantically- annotated services, software agents are essential as the entities responsible for exploiting the semantic content in order to automate some tasks thus improving the user experience.

In this context, semantic technologies play a fundamental role in numerous e-government programs. Indeed, these technologies enable enriching the public service description provided by different public administrations with additional semantic information, which allows automatic services processing and information exchange between involved members in comprehensive and interpretable manner, thus facilitating service integration and cooperation. The most frequently used technologies in this area are semantic web services (SWS) technology and ontology. Thus, for modelling efficiently public services, the authors have exploring, studying and analyzing some of e-government researches and projects that applied semantic technologies. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors address how semantic technologies transform the e-government domain through exploring and studying the use of SWS and ontology in numerous researches and projects applying these technologies in this area. Then, the authors have compared them through a set of criteria defined according to e-government requirements such as the SWS modelling approach for describing semantically public services, ontologies for representing governmental specific features (e.g. regulation and organizational structures) and developed portal for supporting user's perspectives. Based on this study, the authors have identified the appropriate standards, frameworks, and models for developing the framework. Findings: The authors have developed a framework for public services which enhances existing approaches with additional aspects. Thus, the approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of services. This semantic is developed in form of a Sit/Ctx ontology developed based on CSs model represented through conceptual graphs theory. The authors have used this model besides OWL-S, improving thus the level of automation of discovery and composition process of public services, which become more efficient with taken into consideration their interrelations and situations. Originality/value: The approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of public services, providing thus the end-users (people and enterprises) a better orientation in discovery process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2014,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,49-75,,1,8,,Trans.

In such mediated, networked context, an area that presents considerable development degrees in recent years and uncountable social-cultural, technological challenges is the institutionalization of information processes and/or services in government portals. From this perspective, the present work proposes CAfe-G (Common Architecture for e-Government), a comprehensive web-based framework meant to support interoperability among e-government systems, in order to improve the interaction levels of services provided by governments for their citizens (G2C), to support interaction among different governments (G2G), to assist citizens' requests for government services (C2G), and to enhance the relationship among citizens (C2C). Adaptation concerns are also addressed to support effective CzRM (Citizen Relationship Management). The proposed architecture consists in a bus of services and facilities designed to provide a high level of interoperability through a semantic-driven, upper ontologies-based mechanism for publishing and retrieving of such services and facilities. This approach is aimed to provide virtual spaces and communities for major participation of citizens, thus supplying services integration in order to boost the information exchange among different systems. CAfe-G is CORBA-inspired and it was built over concepts brought from AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and FOP (Feature-Oriented Programming). CAfe-G presents a feature set to represent Services related to Semantic, Life Events-Driven Presentation or pertinent to Facilities like Mobile, iDTV (Interactive Digital Television) and Trading Services. CAfe-G would help to reduce the bureaucracy, increase the transparency in governmental actions, intensify citizens' digital inclusion, and speed the use of technology up in governmental agencies, through the information interoperability among countries, governments and citizens.",2006,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,170-179,,,,,,,,,,,Academic Conferences Limited info@academic-conferences.org,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ICEG - 2nd Int.

The availability and quality of electronic services are important indicators of e-Government maturity. However, we argue that our understanding of the concept e-service is poor and we show that the ambiguity surrounding the concept creates problems when building ontologies and thus makes it difficult to achieve better interoperability between systems. We thus propose a model for e-services building on a framework for categorizing services using some basic terms.

Lack of agreement and guidance on the meaning and format of information to be exchanged between Member States are the main stumbling block. Semantic interoperability is jeopardized by different interpretations of the information exchanged between people and applications, thus hampering the effective and efficient creation of new European public services. In an attempt to promote the use of common models and standards, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store semantic data models, taxonomies, codelists and reference data making them openly available for reuse. The term semantic asset has been devised to refer to these types of resources. However, these repositories differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper specifies a generic Exchange API that capitalizes on Linked Data technologies and REST in order to enable the semantic integration of distributed metadata repositories, thus creating a flexible federation which facilitates cross-repository querying and consequently enhances semantic asset reusability.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,905,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.,,,,Interoperability; Metadata; Government data processing; Electronic data interchange; Linked data; Reusability; Linked datum; e-Government; E-Government; ADMS; Federation of semantic asset repositories; Rest; Semantic assets; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 09:44:05,EC1 – Off-topic

The situation can be aptly described by John Naisbitt's quote, 'We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge'. The information overload in intelligent systems has highlighted the restricted ability of knowledge representation (KR) formalisms to cope with various forms of uncertainty in knowledge. Probabilistic extensions of KR formalisms are the most investigated for uncertainty representation. Probabilistic extensions of formal logics offer expressiveness at the cost of tractability of reasoning. On the other hand Probabilistic extensions of graphical models makes simplifying assumptions to achieve better computational performance but are less expressive. In fact one of the most noted problem of probabilistic KR formalisms is the difficulty to achieve the expressiveness-of-representation vs tractability-of-reasoning trade off. In addition the KR formalism for open domains such as Semantic Web need to facilitate information sharing and semantic interoperability as well. Ontologies have already been successfully used as KR formalism as they facilitates semantic interoperability and therefore automated reasoning; one of the essentials to cope with information overload. However traditional ontologies cannot deal with uncertain knowledge. Probabilistic ontologies use probabilistic KR formalisms and therefore can cope up with domain uncertainty. This paper investigates the applicability of probabilistic ontology as a KR formalism for a Semantic Web use case. Previous work on probabilistic ontologies has investigated use cases such as fraud detection, threat detection, and breast cancer detection in government, military and healthcare domains but not in Semantic Web. Uncertainty also manifests in various forms and all of them are often not present in single use case. We have chosen the use case for achieving belief fusion under uncertainty to investigate how probabilistic ontology copes with all three expectations for a semantic web KR formalism; expressiveness, tractability and semantic interoperability. Proposed probabilistic ontology based system automates the background verification part of human recruiting process. This use case is a representative case for belief fusion and asserts Bayesian networks as belief fusion operator. © 2014 IEEE.",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Although ontologies have been used in numerous industrial projects, the problem of semantic interoperability in the industry is still unresolved. One reason for the lack of success of ontologies in the industry is that most industrial ontologies have been developed based on local needs without taking wider applications into account or attempting to learn from earlier ontology initiatives or reuse the existing ontologies. In this position paper, we argue that for widespread adoption and implementation of ontologies, more systematic and coordinated efforts are needed with the participation of industry, academia, and government at an international level. We also hypothesise that a coordinated and systematic ontology development effort will incrementally lead to the creation of an ecosystem of interoperable software applications that support consistent data access and reasoning across the product life cycle. We discuss why efforts such as Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) can promote a methodological ontology development process by introducing modular, and reusable ontologies. We draw examples from two domain areas, namely supply chain management and production planning and scheduling, to demonstrate how industrial notions can be analysed ontologically according to IOF procedures and methods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,420-441,,2,60,,Int J Prod Res,,,,,,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Ontology; Semantics; interoperability; Planning; Ontology's; Life cycle; Semantic interoperability; Ontology development; Position papers; Application programs; Digital manufacturing; Industrial programs; Learn+; Manufacture; Production control; production planning and scheduling; Production planning and scheduling; Reuse; Scheduling; supply chain management; Supply chain management; ZDM; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 10:07:50,EC5 – Non-government focus

The ITIP is based on the use of Semantic Web technologies to integrate a number of data sources, particularly including the bibliographic records of a museum. Moreover, an ontology model was developed to help users search cultural collections by topic concepts. Design/methodology/approach: Two issues were identified that needed to be addressed: the integration of heterogeneous data sources and semantic-based information retrieval. Two corresponding methods were proposed: SPARQL federated queries were designed for data integration across the Web and ontology-driven queries were designed to semantically search by knowledge inference. Furthermore, to help users perform searches easily, three searching interfaces, namely, ethnicity, region and topic, were developed to take full advantage of the content available on the Web. Findings: Most open government data provides structured but non-resource description framework data, Semantic Web consumers, therefore, require additional data conversion before the data can be used. On the other hand, although the library, archive and museum (LAM) community has produced some emerging linked data, very few data sets are released to the general public as open data. The Semantic Web’s vision of “web of data” remains challenging. Originality/value: This study developed data integration from various institutions, including those of the LAM community. The development was conducted based on the mode of non-institution members (i.e. institutional outsiders). The challenges encountered included uncertain data quality and the absence of institutional participation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,337-353,,2,39,,Electron.

Aggregation of urban data according to multiple perspectives through the definition of proper indicators enables urban data exploration at different granularity levels for distinct categories of users. Furthermore, Semantic Web technologies may be used to enable interoperability and improve data access.

The primary and permanent core of this platform is data, and it is the data ready for the information sharing and the provision of seamless public services. Growing digital world has formed the culture of interaction between government and society based on Open Data. The great importance has the ability of consumers to understand the meaning (semantics) determined by the provider, which is essential for the publication of Linked Open Data. The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability. Both data-centric and model-oriented approaches are fundamental for the digital transformation of public administration. In this paper, we give a brief review of the leading countries digitalization experience and use it to outline the criteria characterizing the implementation of a data-centric paradigm. We have conducted the study showing if Russian e-government is ready for the digitalization in terms of the following areas: (1) the practice of information sharing; (2) the preconditions for the shift to a data-centric and model-oriented paradigm; (3) the regulatory barriers of digital transformation. We believe that the lack of data-centricity can become a serious obstacle to fulfill the plans of the “Digital Economy of Russian Federation” program. Therefore, we give some recommendations to introduce the data-centric approach that would enable the use of disruptive digital technologies and support the development of digital government in Russia. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,439-454,,,947,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

This paper presents the Common Data Model (CDM) proposed within the INTEGRATE EU project to homogenize data coming from different clinical partners. This CDM is based on the Reference Information Model (RIM) from the Health Level 7 (HL7) version 3. Semantic capabilities through an SPARQL endpoint were also required to ensure the sustainability of the platform. For the SPARQL endpoint implementation, a comparison has been carried out between a Relational SQL database + D2R and a RDF database. The results show that the first option can store all clinical data received from institutions participating in the project with a better performance. It has been also evaluated by the EU Commission within a patient recruitment demonstrator. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.",2013,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,971,,1-2,192,,,,,,,,IOS Press Nieuwe Hemweg 6B Amsterdam 1013 BG,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Stud.

Given that e-government services extend across different organisational boundaries and heterogeneous infrastructures, there is a critical need to manage the knowledge and information resources stored in these disparate systems. Semantic Web technologies have the potential to manage the knowledge and coordinate Government-to-Government (G2G) processes. Based on the foundations of Semantic Web, including ontologies, knowledge representation, multi-agent systems and web services; Knowledge Management (KM) and G2G processes, we present a vision for KM for G2G process coordination. The Semantic G2G integration can support the transparent flow of semantically enriched information and knowledge, including content and know-how and enable collaborative G2G processes within and across governmental agencies.

The urgency of the task directed on managing the economic systems innovative development in current competitive market conditions is substantiated. Existing approaches and tools to modeling and decision support in strategic management of the developed territorial systems are considered. The paper also introduces an approach to the knowledge base development for intellectual decision support in innovative project management, based on the ontological analysis of knowledge acquisition from various sources. The effective tools to forming the strategic planning innovative system at the regional level, which could ensure the integration of potential innovative projects and programs in the existing model of the reproduction process are presented. One of the main properties of knowledge management systems is emergence, due to which the interaction between specialists based on formalization of knowledge representation and processing in intellectual components development (ontology, knowledge base) contributes to the creation of new knowledge. An advantage of the ontology-based approach to innovation process management is the semantic integration of data and knowledge for the decision support system. It is proposed on the basis of ontological engineering to form a comprehensive tool to development of an integrated model for representing and processing of knowledge at various stages of the innovative projects management process. Further study logic involves development of an integrated ontology that combines a set of ontologies formed to describe the various fields of specialists knowledge in the field of innovative project management, which will provide a clear understanding of the subject concepts, as well as the rules and cases of decision-making based on them. The proposed approach to organizing the intellectual decision support system is focused on the use of public administration in determining the parameters of medium-Term development of the Russian Federation, as well as in development of measures and mechanisms for social, economic and budgetary policy. Increasing the degree of scientific validity and accuracy of the forecast estimates will reduce the risks in adoption and implementation of management decisions. In theoretical aspect it is proposed to develop at the regional level the territorial systems management models and to form the scientific foundation for further development and comprehensive utilization technology of adaptive management and imitation based on modern intelligent information technologies applied for solving the problem of strategies and programs justification in innovative development in Russian regions. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,384-387,,,2019-September,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

It is part of a broader rubric of interoperability or the ability to share geographic information across multiple platforms and contexts. GIScience researchers have made considerable progress towards understanding and addressing the multiple challenges involved in achieving interoperability. For local government agencies interested in sharing spatial data, however, current interoperability approaches based on object-oriented data models represent idealistic solutions to problems of semantic heterogeneity that often exceed the level of sophistication and funding available. They are waiting for the market to decide how interoperability should be resolved. In order to assist in this transition, this paper presents a rule-based Visual Basic application to standardize the semantics of simple spatial entities using several classification systems. We use the example of well-log data, and argue that this approach enables agencies to share and structure data effectively in an interim period during which market and research standards for semantic interoperability are being determined. It contributes to a geospatial data infrastructure, while allowing agencies to share spatial data in a manner consistent with their level of expertise and existing data structures.",2002,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,343-354,,4,29,,Cartogr.

In Europethis process is mainly initiated by the European service directive. Germany actually has started a special project called D115, which shall provide a simple, quick and efficient access to public service information German-wide by using a single phone number 115. One technical problem in the context of D115 is the intelligent and quick routing of incoming calls to the enquiry offices, another is the technical integration and maintenance of the existing public service information repositories and a special semantic problem is the customer-orientated identification, description and the functional exchange of this knowledge between the participating organizations and public service centres. The general goal of this project is building up a virtual network of service centres with one face to the customer like citizens and enterprises, which ensures valid and quick access to information about all available public services in Germany. A crucial prerequisite to reach this goal is the semantic integration of the distributed knowledge about public services that can be found in different locations, organizations and formats mostly formulated in an inconsistent and sometimes misunderstandable manner. Given the multitude and diversity of public authorities, e. g. there are more than 12,000 municipalities in Germany, an intelligent and flexible solution to integrate these different service repositories is needed. During the last years different semantic approaches in general based on ontologies were developed to integrate distributed information about public services. Theses approaches mainly focus on formal and structural aspects of public service descriptions, i.e. which attributes or characteristics should be used to describe a public service. But concepts and solutions for an effective and valid harmonizing of the semantic differences are not available or address thisissueonly partially. In this paper existing approaches for describing public services are examined in regard to the requirements and constraints of public service centres and in the context of the project D115. Furthermore a new approach to define and build of a taxonomy of public services to support the process of providing information in public service centres is proposed. This approach is based on results of a research project of the University of Duisburg-Essen within the context of the D115 initiative in cooperation with the service centres of several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia. The project was designed to gather the requirements for a classification system of public services from the perspective of public service centres as well as to verify the feasibility of this approach in the service centre praxis.",2009,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,355-362,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In the early days of the Semantic Web (1999-2006), research efforts of the community were centered around knowledge representation; thus, most of the research work was focused on building ontologies (ontology engineering), developing formal languages to represent them (ontology language), methodologies to evaluate and evolve ontologies (ontology evaluation and evolution (OE)), and logic for reasoning with them. As a result of this, even though ontologies were being developed but their instantiation was inadequate to provide the actual instance data needed for the evaluation and analysis of the developed ontologies. In order to overcome this issue, test data was often used to perform the above tasks [1]. However, in the recent past, the focus has shifted towards publishing data either with little or no use of ontologies [2]. This shift in focus is credited to the Linked Open Data (LOD) Project which has published billions of assertions on the Web using well known Linked Data principles. Because of this, the research focus has shifted from knowledge-centered to data-centered and is now settling down at the point where domain ontologies are being used to publish real-world data on the Web. This trend promotes consistent and coherent semantic interoperability between users, systems and applications. In this regard, several domain ontologies have been developed to describe the information pertaining to different domains such as Healthcare and Life Science (HCLS), governments, social spaces, libraries, entertainment, financial service and eCommerce. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,813-817,,,7295 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

However, this new business paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure has certain obstacles, including provider lock-in. When a client chooses a specific Cloud service provider, he also gets the provider's specific protocols, standards and tools, making a potential future migration complex and costly. Cloud Computing is still immature, with no firmly established standards governing all the aspects of its utilization. The migration issue can be overcome by using interoperable Cloud services. In this paper we focus on the platform as a service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing. This model provides a complete computing platform needed to run applications over the Internet. Every PaaS provider (such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce) has specified its custom application programming interfaces (APIs). However, to achieve interoperability we need to develop a standardized set of APIs that constitute an interoperability platform. In this paper, we firstly present the key concepts and relevant related work from the existing literature. Thereafter we propose a novel PaaS API ontology to share a common understanding of the main concepts from providers' APIs. We used a prominent ontology development methodology to determine the domain and scope of our ontology, review similar existing ontologies, define the relevant classes and their hierarchy as well as to define the properties of classes and create their instances. The concepts in our ontology were derived from PaaS resources, remote Cloud functions specified in the API documentation of the most important PaaS solutions, existing Cloud ontologies, Cloud Computing models andstandards for Semantic Web services. The aim of the proposed ontology is the description of PaaS resourcesand their operations. It was built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Protege tool. In the future, we plan to use this ontology to semantically annotate PaaS API operations and create a mechanism to determineand solve interoperability problems among two or more PaaS services provided by different vendors.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,47-54,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

BIM creates a collaborative digital representation of built environment data. Competitive advantage can be achieved with collaborative project delivery and rich information modelling. Despite the abundant benefits, BIM’s adoption in the AEC is susceptible to confrontation. A substantial impediment to BIM adoption often cited is data interoperability. Other facets of interoperability got limited attention. Other academic areas, including information systems, discuss the interoperability construct ahead of data interoperability. These interoperability factors have yet to be surveyed in the AEC industry. This study aims to investigate the effect of interoperability factors on BIM adoption and develop a comprehensive BIM adoption model. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical foundations of the proposed model are based on the European interoperability framework (EIF) and technology, organization, environment framework (TOE). Quantitative data collection from construction firms is gathered. The model has been thoroughly examined and validated using partial least squares structural equation modelling in SmartPLS software. Findings: The study’s findings indicate that relative advantage, top management support, government support, organizational readiness and regulation support are determinants of BIM adoption. Financial constraints, complexity, lack of technical interoperability, semantic interoperability, organizational interoperability and uncertainty are barriers to BIM adoption. However, compatibility, competitive pressure and legal interoperability do not affect BIM adoption. Practical implications: Finally, this study provides recommendations containing the essential technological, organizational, environmental and interoperability factors that AEC stakeholders can address to enhance BIM adoption. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies to combine TOE and EIF in a single research model. This research provides empirical evidence for using the proposed model as a guide to promoting BIM adoption. As a result, the highlighted determinants can assist organizations in developing and executing successful policies that support BIM adoption in the AEC industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,606-642,,2,24,,Constr.

Such a metadata set formalizes the exchange of information between portals and registries and assists the service transformation and simplification efforts, while it can be further taken into consideration when applying Web 2.0 techniques in e-Government. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.",2009,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,341-352,,,5693 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Data are deemed a powerful and useful raw material that can impact multidisciplinary research endeavors as well as government, industry, and business performance. Everyone is talking about big data, and it is believed that science, business, industry, government, society, and so forth will undergo a thorough change with the influence of big data [1]. In fact, we now live in the era of big data as huge and complex data sets, which are being produced and collected for diverse purposes through all kinds of technologies or approaches including mobile devices, remote sensing technologies, software logs, wireless sensor networks, and social media. The big data sets tend to be more unstructured, distributed, and complex than ever before [2]. Thus, big data are defined as huge amount of data that require new technologies and architectures so that it becomes possible to extract value from them by capturing and analysis process. Due to such large size of data, it becomes very difficult to perform effective analysis using the existing traditional techniques. Big data due to their various properties like volume, velocity, variety, variability, value, and complexity put forward many challenges [3]. Under the great increase in global data, the term big data is constantly used to describe huge data sets. Compared with traditional data sets, big data typically compose of masses of unstructured data, sensor data, and stream data that need more real-time processing. Big data are characterized by three aspects: (1) data are numerous, (2) data cannot be categorized into regular relational databases, and (3) data are generated, captured, and processed rapidly. Moreover, big data are transforming health care, transportation, aerospace, science, engineering, finance, business, and eventually, the society [4]. In addition, big data also give rise to new opportunities for discovering new values, make us gain an in-depth understanding of the hidden values, and also bring new challenges, for example, how to effectively specify, model, capture, transfer, organize, and manage such data sets [5]. Big data aim to handle high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety data to extract intended data value and ensure high veracity of original data and obtained information that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of data and information processing for enhanced insight, decision making, and process control; all of these demand new data models and new infrastructure services and tools that allow also obtaining from a variety of sources and delivering data in a variety of forms to different data and information consumers and devices [6]. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,139-168,,,,,,,,,,,CRC Press,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Cyber-Physical Systems: From Theory to Practice,,,,LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 10:33:58,EC5 – Non-government focus

Semantically enriched Web services promise to increase the level of automation and to reduce integration efforts significantly. On the other hand, and due to the heterogeneous structure of the public sector, the achievement of interoperability and integration is a key challenge for a comprehensive e-Government. Therefore, the combination of e-Government and Semantic Web Services is very much natural. In this paper, we present a dynamic approach for semantically composing e-Government Web services based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques.

The management of privacy preferences across these devices is a complex task for which users are ill-equipped, which increases privacy risks. In this paper we propose an approach that exploits Semantic Web (SW) technology to manage the user's IoT privacy preferences and negotiate the permissions for data sharing with third parties. SW technology comprises a web of data that can be processed by machines through a formal, universally shared representation. In our approach, SW enables a lightweight and interoperable communication between a Personal Data Manager (PDM) and the Third Parties (TPs) that request access to the user's personal data. The PDM can handle multiple heterogeneous personal IoT devices and manages the negotiation process between the user and the TPs in a way that can relieve users from the burden of specifying their privacy requirement for each TP. The core of the approach is the definition of the Privacy Preference for IoT (PPIoT) Ontology which is based on the Privacy Preference Ontology, the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology, the Fair Information Practices (FIP) principles, and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques for privacy protection in the IoT. This ontology aims to capture the complexity of privacy management in the IoT paradigm in light of the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. Along with presenting the ontology, in this paper we will provide an example on how to use the PPIoT ontology for the management of privacy preferences in the fitness IoT domain and we will show how the PDM handles the process of negotiation between the user and the TPs. The approach is based on an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model (PPM) that meets the requirements of the GDPR to have transparent and simple TP privacy policies. Finally, we will report the results of an evaluation on a mockup fitness app that implements this PPM. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) to propose an ontology for privacy preference in the IoT context, which covers a knowledge gap in existing literature and can be used for IoT privacy management, (ii) to propose an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model, which is in accordance with the GDPR objectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",2020,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,879-898,,,111,,Future Gener Comput Syst,,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Ontology; Data Sharing; Data privacy; IoT; Internet of things; Complex networks; Data sharing and permission management; Fair information practices; General data protection regulations; Interoperable communications; Managers; Privacy ontology; Privacy Preference Manager; Privacy preferences; Privacy requirements; Pulse width modulation; Recommendation techniques; Sensor networks; Shared representations; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 10:35:16,EC5 – Non-government focus

This paper proposes a conceptual framework of ontology based e-government service integration, using Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Scholarship Program (SAKASP) as a case study. SAKASP is a multi-domain program in which students must collect information from various Ministries to complete applications and the administering authority must verify the information supplied by the Ministries. The current implementation of SAKASP is clumsy because it is a mixture of online submission and manual collection and verification of information; its time-consuming and tedious procedures are inconvenient for the applicants and inefficient for the administrators. The proposed framework provides an integrated service by employing semantic web service (SWS) and ontology, improving the current implementation of SAKASP by automatically collecting and processing the related information for a given application. The article includes a typical scenario that demonstrates the workflow of the framework. This framework is applicable to other multi-domain e-government services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",2010,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,403-411,,,4,,Smart Innov. Syst.

The solution combines ETL pipelines, Semantic Web technologies, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Metadata interoperability is achieved via RDF schemas, SKOS vocabularies, and linked data principles; data-level integration is supported through schema mapping, format conversion, and LLM-assisted transformation. A dynamic ETL process uses semantic schema mapping and LLM-driven vocabulary suggestions to reduce manual alignment with domain ontologies. The framework is validated through a formal evaluation strategy combining real-world B2B and B2G case studies with comparative analysis against existing solutions.

According to a report from Computer Economics in 1999, 54% of Internet users are English speakers (""English Will Dominate Web for Only Three More Years,"" Computer Economics, July 9, 1999, http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html). However, it is predicted that there will be only 60% increase in Internet users among English speakers verses a 150% growth among non-English speakers for the next five years. By 2005, 57% of Internet users will be non-English speakers. A report by CNN.com in 2000 showed that the number of Internet users in China had been increased from 8.9 million to 16.9 million from January to June in 2000 (""Report: China Internet users double to 17 million,"" CNN.com, July, 2000, http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.html). According to Nielsen/NetRatings, there was a dramatic leap from 22.5 millions to 56.6 millions Internet users from 2001 to 2002. China had become the second largest global at-home Internet population in 2002 (US's Internet population was 166 millions) (Robyn Greenspan, ""China Pulls Ahead of Japan,"" Internet.com, April 22, 2002, http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,,5911_1013841,0 0.html). All of the evidences reveal the importance of crosslingual research to satisfy the needs in the near future. Digital library research has been focusing in structural and semantic interoperability in the past. Searching and retrieving objects across variations in protocols, formats and disciplines are widely explored (Schatz, B., & Chen, H. (1999). Digital libraries: technological advances and social impacts. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, February, 32(2), 45-50.; Chen, H., Yen, J., & Yang, C.C. (1999). International activities: development of Asian digital libraries. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, 32(2), 48-49). However, research in crossing language boundaries, especially across European languages and Oriental languages, is still in the initial stage. In this proposal, we put our focus on cross-lingual semantic interoperability by developing automatic generation of a cross-lingual thesaurus based on English/Chinese parallel corpus. When the searchers encounter retrieval problems, professional librarians usually consult the thesaurus to identify other relevant vocabularies. In the problem of searching across language boundaries, a cross-lingual thesaurus, which is generated by co-occurrence analysis and Hopfield network, can be used to generate additional semantically relevant terms that cannot be obtained from dictionary. In particular, the automatically generated cross-lingual thesaurus is able to capture the unknown words that do not exist in a dictionary, such as names of persons, organizations, and events. Due to Hong Kong's unique history background, both English and Chinese are used as official languages in all legal documents. Therefore, English/Chinese cross-lingual information retrieval is critical for applications in courts and the government. In this paper, we develop an automatic thesaurus by the Hopfield network based on a parallel corpus collected from the Web site of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Experiments are conducted to measure the precision and recall of the automatic generated English/Chinese thesaurus. The result shows that such thesaurus is a promising tool to retrieve relevant terms, especially in the language that is not the same as the input term. The direct translation of the input term can also be retrieved in most of the cases.",2003,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,671-682,,7,54,,J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci.

The collaboration activities related to near-earth space science data systems and first results in the field of information science between the EU-funded project ESPAS, the Japanese IUGONET project and the GFZ ISDC-based research and development activities are the focus of this paper. The main objective of the collaboration is the use of a Semantic Web approach for the mashup of the project related and so far inoperable data systems. Both the development and use of mapped and/or merged geo and space science controlled vocabularies and the connection of entities in ontology-based domain data model are addressed. The developed controlled vocabularies for the description of geo and space science data and related context information as well as the domain ontologies itself with their domain and cross-domain relationships will be published in Linked Open Data. © 2016 The Author(s).",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,1,68,,Earth Planets Space,,,,,,Springer Berlin,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Semantic Web; Linked Open Data; metadata; European Union; Domain ontology; Controlled vocabulary; data management; Data system; E-science; geology; Germany; research and development; System mashup; technology adoption; Terminological ontology; World Wide Web; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 11:26:17,EC3 – Narrow domain specificity

These projects take place in administrations from different levels and provide solutions that are not driven by a common infrastructure. Main shortcomings due to these phenomena are related to lacks of interoperability and difficulties for locating desired services. As a result, the digital gap may get bigger. To overcome these drawbacks, a semantic approach based on LifeEvents, a concept presented in the paper, is proposed. By means of LifeEvents, an interoperable manner to address needs from the point of view of the citizen is developed. As they are described using OWL, powerful semantic resources are available. A process of analysis in the domain has been conducted and this turns out in a powerful ontology that may support the characterization of Life Events. The goal is to allow not only already defined LifeEvents but also those identified in the future. Even more, once LifeEvents are defined by means of an ontology, they are susceptible of being published under the form of Semantic Web Services. Thus, it is possible to enable enhancements about composition, discovery and organization, as shown in the paper, within the framework of this proposal.

Semantic interoperability make different healthcare systems understand and interpret the meaning of the data that is exchanged, by using and mapping standardized terminologies, coding systems, and data models to describe the concept and structure of data. We propose a solution using Semantic and Structural Mapping techniques within CAREPATH; a research project designed to develop ICT solutions for the care management of elderly multimorbid patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Our technical interoperability solution supplies a standard-based data exchange protocol to enable information exchange between local care systems and CAREPATH components.

However, transportation geo-data sets are at different quality and content and these data does not meet transportation application needs. The first step is to create an interoperable transportation geo-data model. This theme has a harmonized geo-data model for Highway-Airway-Railway-Waterway. In this study, due to specific application needs and full range capabilities of transportation management, feature types in this theme were designed with model-driven approach to provide semantic geo-data interoperability. Second part of this study is to develop web based GIS applications and services to manage transportation geo-data sets interoperable.

However, pieces of information without a context are significantly less valuable. Raw data lacks semantics and it is highly heterogeneous from one data-source to another. This poses a challenge to make it useful. To turn all this data into valuable information it is necessary to enable its combination so that meaningful context can be created. Moreover, it is fundamental to define the mechanisms enabling the adoption and orchestration of advanced (typically AI-enabled) data processing techniques to be applied over the harmonized datasets and data-streams. This paper presents the Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that provides the necessary harmonization and enrichment to datasets and data-streams coming from heterogeneous sources. The value of the enriched data lies on the one hand in the transfer of the data into a semantically grounded knowledge graph and, on the other hand, in the creation of new data through linking, aggregating and reasoning on the data. In both cases, the benefit of employing linked-data modelling and semantics comes from the extension of the metadata that is associated to every piece of information. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation of the DET implementation that we have carried out is also presented in the paper. © 2013 IEEE.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,103079-103091,,,11,,IEEE Access,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Semantic Web; Semantics; Public administration; Data handling; Data interoperability; data interoperability; Internet of things; Annotation; Data augmentation; Data enrichment; Data enrichments; Data integrity; data linking; data processing; Datalinking; Europe; Heterogeneous networks; heterogenous data; Heterogenous data; semantic annotation; Semantic annotations; Soft sensors; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 11:33:37,EC2 – Tool- or implementation-only focus

Such a complex framework tends to increase multi-level governance in the period 2007-2013, promoting a wider participation of stakeholders (including Public Administration, Local Communities, Enterprises, etc). This process has been usually accompanied by e-tools for the management of bottom-up processes, with several instances related to common problems of participation processes. Communication between "" programmer"" and categories of beneficiaries always presented weakness due to the ineffective system of management knowledge within the process. Relevant issues in the framework of regional development programmes are: Do stakeholders understand the meaning of general and sectoral policies? Are citizens aware of technical instruments implementing such policies? Are they conscious of ex-ante comprehensive context analysis and/or can they share possible future scenarios? A way to tackle these problems is the use of ontologies. In this work we present the structural elements of the ontology of regional development programmes analyzing major steps of the ontology design and nodal phases of the ontology building (i.e. consensus on relations and restrictions, switch from glossary to taxonomy). The result of such an application is an ontology of regional development containing more than one hundred classes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",2010,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,243-253,,PART 2,112 CCIS,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

The methodological approach will use the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Every archaeological investigation in Austria has to be documented according to the requirements of the Austrian Federal Monuments Office. This documentation is deposited in the CERN-based EU supported research data repository ZENODO. For each deposited file, metadata are created through the application of the conceptual metadata schema CIDOC CRM, an ISO standard for Cultural Heritage Information, which was adopted by ARIADNE, the European Union Research Infrastructure for archaeological resources. Concepts specific to mining archaeology research are organized with the DARIAH Back Bone Thesaurus, a model for sustainable interoperable thesauri maintenance, developed in the European Union Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Metadata are created through the extraction of information from the documentation and the transformation to a knowledge graph using semantic web standards. To facilitate usage, graph data are exported to hierarchical and tabular formats representing sites and objects with their geographic locations, temporal and typological assignments and links to the research activities and documents. Metadata are deposited together with the documentation into the repository. © 2020, The Author(s).",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,267-277,,3,22,,Int. J.

RDF ontologies were developed to break apart the government data silos and stimulate data reuse. However, ontology design still encounters a number of difficulties. Since domain experts are generally unfamiliar with RDF, a design process is needed that allows these experts to efficiently contribute to intermediate ontology prototypes. We designed the OSLO2 ontologies using UML, a modeling language well known within the government, as a single source specification. From this source, the ontology and other relevant documents are generated. This paper describes the conversion tooling and the pragmatic approaches that were taken into account in its design. While this tooling is somewhat focused on the design principles used in the OSLO2 project, it can serve as the basis for a generic conversion tool.

This is proved on the manners and areas that life was computerized such as in trade, government services, medicine, education, learning etc.Nevertheless, the fast development of designing information systems has created several sub-systems in multiple contexts which are conceived by different communities and totally dispersed geographically but all undertaking the same area. Neither contents nor services that these subsystems are made are certainly in the same technology environments. In our research, the learning field goes through many key steps. Actually, new revolutionized practices were implemented due to technology innovation, so transition from classical learning towards distance learning or d-learning is more than possible, it’s desired. Consequently, this phenomenon has created more opportunities for learners and teachers but also several challenges; in many cases, the multitude of standards hinders the learner migration from a learning environment to another, so it hampers its learning development.In this paper, we will propose a framework of interoperability based on three levels. Since we are interested in semantic level, we propose a process of interoperability of learning content in the cloud era based on a global ontology. Like recommendation systems, we will start our process by acquisition, then validation and finally structuration of the learning content. This structuration way will give to both actors of learning environment a certain flexibility and access to other resources in Cloud environment. The basic principle is to collect content, to enrich it and to make it interoperable by using unified approach in star based on a comprehensive ontology.

A key, technological challenge in electronic governance is to ensure that the meaning of data items is accurately recorded, and accessible in an economical-effectively, automatic - fashion. In response, a variety of data and metadata standards have been put forward: from government departments, from industry groups, and from organisations such as the ISO and W3C. This paper shows how the leading standard for metadata registration - ISO 11179 - can be deployed without the need for a single, monolithic conceptualisation of the domain, and hence without the need for universal agreement upon a particular model of electronic governance. The advantages of this approach are discussed with regard to the UK eGovern-ment Interoperability Framework (eGIF) and the UK Integrated Public Sector Vocabulary (IPSV).

The authros introduce a multiagent system (OSIRIS – Ontology-based Spatial Information and Resource Integration Services) to semantically interoperate complex spatial services and integrate them in a meaningful composition. The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. The authors also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS using Description Logics. The system illustrates an application of domain ontology of urban environmental hydrology and evaluation of decision maker’s consequences of land use changes.

The main objective of the project is to realize the content-based search of Earth Observation (EO) images on an application specific basis. The satellite images, which come from EO satellites such as Sentinels 1, 2 and 3, as well as ENVISAT, are distributed with few correlated meta-data which do not describe the phenomena and the objects included in the image. Innovative approaches to process remote sensing images can extract relevant information which semantically describes the land type, the region area border, objects and events such as oil spill. This information can be modeled as structured information through ontologies to be processed by algorithms to perform information retrieval and filtering. The proposed system is aware of the semantic elements which are relevant for final user and will be able to answer natural language queries such as ""Show me the images of the Mediterranean Sea which include an algal bloom"". The possibility to retrieve a specific set of land images starting from a query expressed by a final user can quickly increase the interoperability and the diffusion of applications able to efficiently use EO data. In this work, we present a brief overview of the most successful application of this formalization strategy focusing on the tools and approaches for creating a robust and efficient domain geo-ontology. Furthermore, we describe the approach adopted to define the specific ontology used in the SEO-DWARF project, including the strategy adopted for implementing and populating it. © 2018 SPIE.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,10773,,,,,,,,SPIE spie@spie.org,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,,,,Semantic Web; Ontology; Query processing; Earth observation data; Earth Observation data; Electrooptical devices; Geodetic satellites; Image retrieval; Information filtering; Information retrieval and filtering; Innovative approaches; Natural language processing systems; Natural language queries; Observatories; Oil spills; Question Answering; Remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Semantic representation; Structured information; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,"Themistocleous, K.; Michaelides, S.; Ambrosia, V.; Papadavid, G.; Hadjimitsis, D.G.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 11:49:44,EC1 – Off-topic

These models impede sustainable developments by forming data silos that hinder cross-application data exchange and knowledge discovery processes. Although Semantic Web solutions hold promise in addressing these silos, current approaches primarily focus on developing novel ontologies, yielding similar outcomes. But it is unclear how these methodologies could support broader knowledge discovery processes and application requirements. This paper addresses these research challenges by introducing a dynamic knowledge graph as implemented within The World Avatar for interoperable building models. We demonstrate its value through two distinct applications in urban energy management and laboratory automation. The dynamic knowledge graph revolves around a comprehensive structured knowledge model constructed from ontologies and agents. Ontologies semantically annotate data and represent domain knowledge and their relationships with standardised definitions. When augmented with an agent architecture, the resulting knowledge model can align stakeholder perspectives and accommodate the dynamic and scalable nature of urban data. Moreover, the dynamic knowledge graph fosters innovative human-machine interactions through visualisation interfaces to augment knowledge discovery processes in the built environment for greater efficiencies and innovation. As the knowledge model expands, users gain access to a broader spectrum of private and public data sources and technologies, while reducing integration barriers. This is especially pertinent for smaller and less influential entities like municipal and local governments with limited resources, who can realise substantial benefits at reduced costs. © 2024",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,91,,J.

A wide range of heterogeneous data is managed by different stakeholders, thus demanding solutions to support integration issues such as interoperability and ambiguity. In a previous work, we proposed an ontology for Emergency Response Systems, called EDXL-RESCUER, in the scope of the RESCUER project. In this paper, we present the usage of this ontology in a data exchange solution (DILS: Data Integration with Legacy Systems), which aims to provide semantic interoperability between Emergency Response Systems, and the evolution of EDXL-RESCUER. To evaluate the proposed solution, EDXL-RESCUER & DILS, we performed two studies: (i) simulations using two real data sources, the Police Reports from Bahia Public Safety and Security Department, Brazil; and the Canadian Disaster Database; (ii) an emergency simulation at an Industrial Park in Bahia, Brazil. The results demonstrate the potential use of the EDXL-RESCUER as a common vocabulary to support semantic interoperability between emergency response systems. We also verified the feasibility of using the DILS solution in emergency management scenarios. Besides EDXL-RESCUER & DILS, a mapping and integration of concepts related to data exchange are presented. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,264-283,,3,13,,Int.

Currently, a topical issue is to unite these information systems, create favourable conditions for their information interaction. This task is particularly important for the creation of an information infrastructure in the electronic government, which involves both large-scale state systems and applications automating local functions. The main part of system interoperability is defined by semantics – tools for transfer of meaningful data, information. Semantics in information space is defined by two components: identification of objects and NameSpace. In different information spaces the problem of semantics provision is solved in a customized way. In semantic web, it is possible to use standard NameSpaces, or create your own one. An automatically generated URI is used as identifiers. There are alternative options to reproduce semantics in the framework of information infrastructure. In practice, there are cases where identifiers are a profound business key containing information about individual elements of business logic, the result of which is the object described. The article describes examples of such practice and shows elements of the methodology for creating such identifiers. The second semantics element is the namespace. In this field, serious groundwork has been made in different economy sectors. There is a tendency of interaction between separate dictionaries and development of uniform approaches. This can be implemented through creation of templates. Currently, the prerequisites for combination of two elements of semantics definition are fulfilled: identifiers and namespaces. This would make it possible to move quickly towards the creation of an e-government information infrastructure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,78-89,,,858,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

The author initiates discussion by presenting the classification of functional information, briefly reviewing literature to justify the classification of systems in archival information systems. Then, he presents the business plan classification and how it was constructed, to later conclude that it is a new approach not only in the organization, representation and retrieval of information/knowledge, but also in the management of archival information, making it a matrix model that links functions to business processes. Also, despite the importance of this tool, he recognizes the need to develop the business plan classification tool to an ontology based on WOL (Web Ontology Language), a language for knowledge representation, which has been proposed by W3C as a ‘standard’ to codify ontologies from the semantic web’s perspective. © 2016 International Society for Knowledge Organization.

Web services appear to be the middleware solution of the future for highly interoperable distributed software solutions. In parallel, research on the Semantic Web provides the results required to exploit distributed machine-processable data. Organizations like W3C and the EU have begun a number of research projects to combine these research lines into industrial-strength applications. In Enabling Semantic Web Services, Dieter Fensel and his contributors offer a thorough, practical introduction to one of the most promising approaches - the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO). After a brief review of basic technologies and standards of the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and Web Services, they examine WSMO from the fundamentals to possible applications in e-commerce, e-government and e-banking; they also describe its relation to other approaches like OWL-S and WSDL-S.

It proposes the creation of URI identifiers for legislation based on common components and the description of their metadata based on an ontology relying on FRBRoo; the ELI ontology includes in particular the description of the FRBR levels of abstraction, the needed date properties to describe legislation and links to relate legislative acts. Legislation metadata is thus viewed as a global graph of interconnected entities. While ELI tries to lower the entry barrier for legal publishers to disseminate structured metadata and currently counts 13 implementations, it is also facing challenges to progress towards its full potential: data quality, description of ELI datasets, alignment of thematic vocabularies or granular description of the text subdivisions. ELI has the potential to facilitate access to legal information by enabling unambiguous legal citations mark-up, giving legislation more visibility in major web search engines, describing early legislation drafts or facilitating the exchange of data between legal information systems. ELI is tightly connected to novel legal information system architectures, based on legal knowledge graphs; this style of architecture encourages legal publishers to move from a document-centric perspective towards a data-centric perspective, as exemplified by the Casemates in Luxembourg and the Cellar at the Office of Publications of the European Union. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,137-148,,,317,,,,,,,,IOS Press BV,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Front.

These applications store useful data for decision-making. However, data items often remain spread in different applications, each of which adopt different data and behavioral models, posing a barrier for integrated data usage. As a consequence, data-driven decisions in agile development are uncommon, missing valuable opportunities for informed decision making. Objective: Considering the need to address semantic issues to properly integrate applications that support the agile development process, we aim to provide a common and comprehensive conceptualization about Scrum in the software development context and apply this conceptualization to support application integration. Method: We have developed the Scrum Reference Ontology (SRO) and used it to semantically integrate Azure DevOps and Clockify. Results: SRO served as a reference model to build software artifacts in a semantic integration architecture that enables applications to automatically share, exchange and combine data and services. The integrated solution was used in the software development unit of a Brazilian government agency. Results demonstrate that the integrated solution contributed to improving estimates, provided data that helped allocate teams, manage team productivity and project performance, and enabled to identify and fix problems in the Scrum process execution. Conclusions: SRO can serve as an interlingua for application integration in the context of Scrum-process support. By capturing the conceptualization underlying Scrum, the reference ontology can address semantic conflicts and thereby support the development of integrated data-driven solutions for decision making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,136,,Inf Software Technol,,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Ontology; Semantics; Integration; Reference modeling; Decision making; Data integration; Semantic Interoperability; Application programs; Application integration; Application Integration; Data driven decision; Government agencies; Integrated solutions; Project management; Project management tools; Scrum; Semantic integration; Software design; Team productivities; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-17 11:58:26,EC1 – Off-topic

Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in an online catalogue to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Commission has developed Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP), as a standard European PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and semantic interoperability. However, CPSV-AP is not sufficient to model complex PS with different versions based on rules and citizens’ circumstances (e.g., getting a passport for a child or for an emergency). As a result, citizens cannot obtain personalized information on PS. The aim of this paper is to enhance CPSV-AP in order to support the modeling of complex PS. We illustrate the use of the proposed model in a real-life case study. Specifically, we use the proposed model to develop a knowledge graph and a chatbot that provides personalized information to citizens of the city of Bjelovar (Croatia) regarding the life-event “having a baby”. We believe our research is of interest to researchers on PS data models and public authorities interested in providing personalized PS information to their citizens using chatbots. © 2022 by the authors.

It therefore becomes crucial to rigorously assess the information workflows associated with built assets in order to help deliver the subsequent assessment services and certification schemes. The Smart Readiness Indicator is a new assessment scheme directed at harmonizing the smartness levels of buildings and intelligent installations at a European level. While the European Union defines the Smart Readiness Indicator scope and assessment methodology towards new regulations with the member states, the availability of data should strategically rely on existing sources such as the Building Information Model in order to automate and simplify the efforts of assessors. This paper explores the potential of Building Information Model data, more specifically relying on the Industry Foundation Classes schema, to support assessors with more automatic extraction of relevant information on the building and its equipment. The adopted methodology looks at the semantic alignment between the two domains. An initial alignment of concepts from several versions of the Industry Foundation Classes is proposed. This alignment was implemented using several rules, which were tested on the architectural and mechanical models of the same building. The study shows the convenience of employing such a methodology, the usefulness of data from existing building models, but also their limitations in correctly identifying relevant concepts. © 2022 IEEE.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

The Semantic Web consists of key technologies such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), ontologies, triple stores (database for RDF), and SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL), which is a query language for triple stores.

The ever increasing amount of linked data in government open data, social linked data, linked medical and patients' data provides new opportunities for data mining and machine learning. Both are however strongly de-pendent on the selection of high quality data features to achieve good results. In this work we present an approach that uses ontological knowledge to generate features that are suitable for building a decision tree classifier addressing the specific data set and classification problem. The approach that we present has two main characteristics - it generates new features on demand as required by the induction algorithm and uses ontological knowledge about linked data to re-strict the set of possible options. These two characteristics enable the induction algorithm to look for features that might be connected through many entities in the linked data enabling the generation of cross-domain explanation models.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,90-98,,,1733,,,,,,,,CEUR-WS,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.,,,,Semantic Web; Ontology; Data mining; Data handling; Cross-domain; Artificial intelligence; Linked datum; Decision trees; Open datum; Different domains; Medical computing; Classification (of information); Trees (mathematics); Decision tree classifiers; Feature generation; High quality data; Induction algorithms; Learning systems; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,"Mizoguchi, R.; Cudre-Mauroux, P.; Noy, N.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 08:17:02,EC1 – Off-topic

Those information systems usually take the form of workflow systems. Due to the large social impact of e-government systems, computer security plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficiency and effectiveness. Access control is one of the key aspects of computer security. Current access control models do not take into account the context of the system and its environment. In this article, we argue that a formal context-sensitive access control model can improve the development of e-government workflow systems and present a particular context-sensitive access control model. The subject of the article is a specification of the context-sensitive access control model for business processes (COBAC). By using a context-sensitive access control, it is possible to define more sophisticated access control policies that cannot be implemented by existing access control models. The COBAC's context is modeled using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in order to provide formal representation of context, rich representation of diverse contextual information, semantic interoperability between various context-aware systems, and a high degree of inference making. The presented model is applicable in different e-government systems, and supports the definition of access control policies for both simple and complex business processes. The model's prototype is verified by a case study on a real e-government business process-the national petty offense trial proceedings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,184-213,,2,22,,J.

Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) provide a key to disclosing the potential of Open Government data, by supplying common terms for marking up metadata and data in a consistent and coherent way. However, quality information is needed to help public institutions decide whether to adopt an existing or newly created CV. The paper discusses how to evaluate and document CV quality thus facilitating a comparison of different controlled vocabularies based on contextual information. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to assess the overall quality and rank of a controlled vocabulary, by integrating various quality dimensions according to the decision maker's needs. A set of e-Government controlled vocabularies that facilitate the semantic interoperability of e-Government data are selected as a testbed, and updated quality values are made available as Linked Data. Multi-step guidelines are also defined promoting and complementing the adoption of W3C recommendations to provide machine-readable quality metadata. This fosters reliability and re-usability by providing consumers with information on the assessment process carried out and the outcomes achieved. We illustrate the application of these guidelines by focusing on provenance and quality documentation. © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,144-160,,1,9,,IEEE Trans. Emerg.

Semantic Web based solutions for E-Governance provide real time intelligence by making the machine understand the information and takes intelligent decision by integrating heterogeneous data from distributed sources in more autonomous way. In existing E-Governance, duplicate information spread throughout different department datasets. Failing to maintain consistent information across the datasets of departments leads to incorrect and unreliable result to the user query. The e-services themselves are not interoperable, hence it makes difficult for the citizen to access the services and it is not possible to refine a new service. This paper aims at the design of semantic web based Indian E-Governance system for connecting the distributed heterogeneous data of various e-services. The proposed method creates a unique access point for the services so that they can be easily accessed and interconnected. In order to maintain consistent citizen information, common citizen ontology is built and shared among the e-services of certain government departments. The proposed system uses the unique-id for the citizen to enable easy integration of distributed data of various services and greater service delivery. This method also effectively increases the efficiency of data management. The proposed system allows the user to select any service using dedicated URI and make a query from anywhere at any time. After the semantic translation, the user query is sent to the semantic server. The agent with the help of knowledge base automatically finds and integrates the relevant information from various services and gives the correct decision to the user. Thus, semantically enabled e-governance framework provides intelligent inference for the user query and efficient accessibility of all services. The proposed system makes the maintenance easier as it allows for the information reuse, interoperability, sharing and automatic discovery of new services. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,26-36,,1,85,,Eur.

Also, the set of standards that were adopted in SPCoop includes specifications that have since been replaced by newer versions and show little coverage by existing implementations. SAscha is a Web tool intended to address such issues, offering an essentially simple WYSIWYM approach to annotating Web Service descriptors with SAWSDL references to concepts within domain ontologies which are stored in an ad-hoc repository. SAscha is provided as a Rich Internet Application (RIA) so as to be deployed as an infrastructural service itself for immediate use, without any need to resort to potentially complex client applications.",2008,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,426,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.,,,,Interoperability; Web services; Knowledge representation; Interoperability framework; Domain ontologies; Administrative process; Client applications; Descriptors; Domain knowledge representations; Rich internet application (RIA); Semantic value; Semi-automatics; Service interoperability; Web tools; WYSIWYM; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 09:58:20,EC2 – Tool- or implementation-only focus

With recent efforts, a need for improved interoperability, translation, and sustainability of Federal nanoEHS data in the United States has been realized. The NaKnowBase (NKB) is a relational database containing experimental results generated by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) regarding the actions of engineered nanomaterials on environmental and biological systems. Through the interaction of the National Nanotechnology Initiative’s Nanotechnology Environmental Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group, and the Database and Informatics Interest Group (DIIG), a U.S. Federal nanoEHS Consortium has been formed. Methods: The primary goal of this consortium is to establish a “common language” for nanoEHS data that aligns with FAIR data standards. A second goal is to overcome nomenclature issues inherent to nanomaterials data, ultimately allowing data sharing and interoperability across the diverse U.S. Federal nanoEHS data compendium, but also in keeping a level of consistency that will allow interoperability with U.S. and European partners. The most recent version of the EPA NaKnowBase (NKB) has been implemented for semantic integration. Computational code has been developed to use each NKB record as input, modify and filter table data, and subsequently output each modified record to a Research Description Framework (RDF). To improve the accuracy and efficiency of this process the EPA has created the OntoSearcher tool. This tool partially automates the ontology mapping process, thereby reducing onerous manual curation. Conclusions: Here we describe the efforts of the US EPA in promoting FAIR data standards for Federal nanoEHS data through semantic integration, as well as in the development of NAMs (computational tools) to facilitate these improvements for nanoEHS data at the Federal partner level. ©: © 2024 Mortensen HM et al.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,13,,F1000 Res.,,,,,,F1000 Research Ltd,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,"human; Humans; ontology; Article; computer aided design; conceptual framework; database; Databases, Factual; drug industry; environmental health; Environmental Health; factual database; government; knowledge; nanomaterial; Nanostructures; nanotechnology; Nanotechnology; peer review; public health; training; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 09:59:52,EC3 – Narrow domain specificity

Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to a set of best practices that empower enterprises to publish and interlink their data using existing ontologies on the World Wide Web. Current research in LOD focuses on expert search, the creation of unified information space and augmentation of core data from an enterprise context. However, existing approaches for publication of enterprise data as LOD are domain-specific, ad-hoc and suffer from lack of uniform representation across domains. The paper proposes a novel methodology called LinkED that contributes towards LOD literature in two ways: (a) streamlines the publishing process through five stages of cleaning, triplification, interlinking, storage and visualization; (b) addresses the latest challenges in LOD publication, namely: inadequate links, inconsistencies in the quality of the dataset and replicability of the LOD publication process. Further, the methodology is demonstrated via the publication of digital repository data as LOD in a university setting, which is evaluated based on two semantic standards: Five-Star model and data quality metrics. Overall, the paper provides a generic LOD publication process that is applicable across various domains such as healthcare, e-governance, banking, and tourism, to name a few.",2017,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,191-209,,3,25,,J.

Both have unique use cases and value, but they have several overlapping use cases and features. Most notably they are both used for observation, such as the case of climate monitoring or surveying and mapping. Satellites also have uses in communication and navigation by broadcasting signals and enabling technology such as global positioning systems (GPS). UAVs have also been deployed by the militaries across the world for both reconnaissance and offensive capabilities. Each are electro-mechanical systems with a several important components that need to be reliable and high performance. Maximizing the return in value for these assets might mean improving their performance, reliability, or longevity. One emerging technology that has the promise to do this is the digital twin (DT). DTs utilize a combination of multi-domain modeling and extensive data collection for real-time model updates. This real time updating can be utilized for advanced simulation, improved control, and advanced condition monitoring. DTs are an ideal platform for applying to UAVs and satellites to maximize their capabilities and values. As will be demonstrated in this work, DTs have been demonstrated to provide value in improving control performance, orientation and position tracking, condition monitoring, and fault detection in UAVs and satellites.

In countries like Vietnam, where land-related procedures are governed by a comprehensive legal framework, practical challenges persist due to uncoordinated records and complex administrative processes. To support the country’s ongoing digital transformation and legal modernization efforts, this paper introduces ViLUR, a system that integrates blockchain and semantic technologies to manage LUR in compliance with Vietnam’s 2024 Land Law and related regulations. ViLUR combines blockchain technology for secure, immutable record-keeping with the Land Use Rights Ontology (LUROn), which formally models ownership structures, legal entities, and regulatory constraints. Using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, the system automates legal compliance checks for key procedures including ownership issuance, change registration, and land recovery. Deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric framework, ViLUR is experimentally evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, and reasoning time. Results show promising improvements in transaction speed, transparency, and legal consistency. The system demonstrates practical potential for modernizing land administration and aligns closely with Vietnam’s national goals for e-government and digital transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,Artif Intell Law,,,,,,Springer Nature,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Ontology; Semantics; Blockchain; Legal compliance; LUR in Vietnam; SWRL rule; LR_Query: Scopus_02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 10:07:31,EC2 – Tool- or implementation-only focus

Despite real-time availability of 'big data' from ubiquitous sensors, mobile devices, 3D printing of drugs, and a mind shift in data ownership, data integration still remains one of the core challenges to innovation. Increasingly persistent, semantic data integration is gaining recognition for its dynamic data model and formalisms which make it possible to infer from and reason over interconnected contextualized data, creating actionable knowledge faster and at lower cost. While such technical advances underpin the successful strategies to drive positive patient outcomes or accelerate drug design, there are equally profound social changes towards the willingness of patients to share their own data - opening doors to new patient-centric, precision-medicine healthcare models. Adding astronomically rising costs in research and healthcare, we have arrived at a critical turning point where it is now well within our reach to change how drugs are developed, how trials are performed and how patients are treated - and we can do this with huge benefits for otherwise unsustainable industries. Examples show that not only is this possible today, but that such approaches already have traction; (i) in Pharma for assessing impact of excipient on drug stability and efficacy; for pre-clinical toxicity assessment and integral systems views on drug safety, (ii) in Government at the FDA's cross species biomarker initiative to reduce animal testing and (iii) in Health Care for organ transplant rejection assessment and COPD. Using comparative effectiveness and side effect analyses to base treatments on solid prognoses and therapy decision support, we can and must change discovery and healthcare into a data driven and patient centric paradigm.

Forward thinking developers are expressing interest in developing methods to track the actual operations of new urban developments and campuses. Local governments and developers are exploring how to ensure that the built infrastructure, including buildings, transportation, energy generation and storage assets, is not only designed for energy efficiency, but operates efficiently as well. There is a need for city and district scale tools to support energy analysis from design through operations. Smart city data analytics is a growing area of interest in the smart city technology space. However, while there is enthusiasm for the concept of smart city energy analytics, there is a lack of common semantic data models, interoperable systems, and methods to collect data and support decision-making for operating multi-building city- and district-scale energy systems. Urban developers are asking broad questions about how such a system might be designed, built, valued, maintained, and optimized.

This research investigates the application of ontologies in the field of public sector strategy management to enhance the capacity of organizations to make informed data-driven decisions, efficiently allocate resources, and effectively navigate the intricate landscape of the public sector. The LNEC - National Laboratory for Civil Engineering's strategy is used as an exploratory case study. Semantic web technologies are used to perform strategy analysis, including validating the strategy formulation and supporting the strategy execution by assessing performance indicators, verifying the design of cause-and-effect relationships between strategic objectives, and monitoring and empirically validating these relationships. The increased interoperability of these technologies enables information sharing across systems and organizations. Following the strategy analysis, recommendations are provided, leading to a more robust and data-driven strategic management approach, enabling accurate, traceable, and continuous monitoring of an organization's strategy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, along with limitations and future work. This research offers a blueprint for public sector organizations seeking to optimize their strategies, foster transparency, and deliver more effective services to the public they serve. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,3,5,,Digit.

Advances in Information and Communications Technologies have supported innovations in Knowledge Management (KM). Since the KM has been recognized as one of the critical factors for obtaining organizational competitiveness. KM is among the promising areas for the application of Semantic Web. In this paper we propose an approach to the development of a technological platform for KM that integrates semantic Web technologies. This platform supports all processes required in knowledge management. Therefore, the platform enables the automatic identification of patterns and generation of the taxonomies from unstructured texts (documents). The platform consists of tools that allow storing documents (from a knowledge contributor interface), processing of source documents, i.e. identifying sentences, stop-words, identifying n-grams, and generating bags of words, denoting lexical patterns, taxonomic-relation extraction, and inference algorithms to retrieve knowledge from a set of repositories. These algorithms use the previous phases to retrieve knowledge more accurately derived from the semi-structured or structured information previously generated. © 2015 IEEE.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,168-172,,,2016-February,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This is due to the fact that web content is multimedial, social and dynamic. Moreover, concepts referred by videos, news, comments, posts, are implicitly linked by the fact that people on the Web talks about something, somewhere at some time and these connections may change as the perception of users on the Web changes over time. We define a model for the integration of the heterogeneous and dynamic data coming from different knowledge sources (broadcasters' archives, online newspapers, blogs, web encyclopedias, social media platforms, social networks, etc.). We use a knowledge graph to model all the heterogenous aspects of the information in an homogeneous way. Through a case study on social TV, we provide a non trivial cross-domain analysis scenario on real data gathered from YouTube and Twitter, and related to an Italian TV talk show on politics, broadcasted by RAI, the Italian public-service broadcasting organization.

This raises the engineering issues of integration, reusability, maintenance and interoperability of autonomous eGovernment systems of government departments and agencies. Therefore, appropriate methodologies which consistently address the aforementioned engineering issues throughout eGovernment development phases are needed. This study presents a methodology framework which amalgamates features from maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains for a unified and agile semantic-driven development of eGovernment systems. Firstly, the methods and techniques currently used for the planning, design, and implementation of eGovernment systems worldwide are investigated; a critical analysis is carried out to identify their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their contribution towards addressing the aforementioned engineering issues. Secondly, the proposed methodology framework is drawn and described. Finally, a flowchart is used to specify the iterative and incremental business process model of the proposed methodology framework. The aims of the study are twofold: (1), providing direction for the semantic-driven development of future eGovernment systems which would facilitate their integration and interoperability towards onestop eGovernment, and (2), unifying the currently used methods and techniques for efficient planning and implementation of future eGovernment systems based on semantic technologies. The main contribution of the study is the investigation and amalgamation of features from the maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains to enable the planning and agile semantic-driven implementation of future eGovernment systems.

Most of the data and statistics made available on government web sites are aggregate, however, until now, we have not had a suitable linked data representation available. We propose a way to express summary statistics across aggregate groups as linked data using Web Ontology Language (OWL) Class based sets, where members of the set contribute to the overall aggregate value. Additionally, many clinical studies in the biomedical field rely on demographic summaries of their study cohorts and the patients assigned to each arm. While most data query languages, including SPARQL, allow for computation of summary statistics, they do not provide a way to integrate those values back into the RDF graphs they were computed from. We represent this knowledge, that would otherwise be lost, through the use of OWL 2 punning semantics, the expression of aggregate grouping criteria as OWL classes with variables, and constructs from the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), and the World Wide Web Consortium’s provenance ontology, PROV-O, providing interoperable representations that are well supported across the web of Linked Data. We evaluate these semantics using a Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of patient case information from the Genomic Data Commons, a data portal from the National Cancer Institute. © © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

To overcome this, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store reusable data models, schemata, taxonomies and codelists. We use the term semantic interoperability asset to refer to these types of resources. These repositories however differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, even bypass the domain it was originally designed for, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets' descriptions hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper introduces the Asset Description Metadata Schema, an initiative of the ISA programme of the European Commission, which aims to deliver a common metamodel for semantic interoperability assets. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",2013,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,10-18,,1,64,,Comput Ind,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Semantics; Metadata; Government data processing; Electronic data interchange; Semantic interoperability; Metadata repositories; Reusability; e-Government; ADMS; Asset; Metadata repository; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 10:22:10,EC3 – Narrow domain specificity

The scenario helps the user to identify and fulfil any needed electronic or real governmental services in a selected life situation. The Access-eGov project has developed software tools enabling service integration using semantic technologies. In addition to that, a methodology providing guidance to the user-driven process of creating ontologies was developed. Sample ontologies were prepared for trial applications.

Coupling these frameworks, the authors propose an extension of cognitive approaches for autonomy in C4ISR to e-Government in general and outline a research agenda for attaining it. © 2020 IEEE Computer Society.

Industry 4.0, a digitalization endeavour by the government of Germany for the factories of the future, aims to create intelligent, self-organized, and self-optimized smart factories by combining the IoT, cloud computing and artificial intelligence together. Interoperability is one of the crucial aspects of Industry 4.0 which requires standardized information models and exchange mechanisms for heterogeneous platform integration. Despite the development of various industry standards, this still remains the biggest burden due to multiple protocols, technologies, and policies involved. A common understanding of data semantics can be helpful in mitigating such problem. This paper provides a detailed comparison between the modelling approaches of Open Platform Communication Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and Resource Description Framework (RDF) and its extension languages. The aim is to garner a common understanding between these two modelling frameworks in order to generate a standardized mapping between them for the purpose of interoperable industrial applications. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,1297-1300,,,2019-September,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

Designing a suitable architectural framework is required to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of such systems. Consolidating public services about citizens’ safety and authorisation decisions when a resource is accessed in an open-dynamic environment are the main challenges that can be highlighted. Therefore, the semantic heterogeneity between the local policies of the different domains is a crucial lock for implementing this process. Our approach goes beyond the semantic web languages’ weaknesses by combining the XACML-based security policy model with a semantic rules language developed during the European SembySem Project. Built on top of RDF(S), the proposed model aims to abstract the security implementation, reconcile semantic differences across multi-domain, and maintain the local security policy. Moreover, this model addresses the semantic heterogeneity of sensors’ data during knowledge-sharing. © © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:08:39,,1-17,,1,43,,Int.

Governing public enterprise BPs requires the ability to control and guide BP activities according to applied laws. Ensuring compliance of processes with legal regulations becomes a critical government requirement. This paper proposes an ontology-based framework for regulatory-compliance management that provides an integrated view of the law architecture model, public enterprise model, and BP lifecycle to enable the design of compliance solutions that cover the full business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design time, runtime, and offline monitoring and analysis. The proposed framework is based on an integrated semantic model representing the business process model and administrative laws concepts which provide a shared conceptualization of the BP activities and the related legal rules. This work seeks to lay down the requirements of an integrated architecture for semantic regulatory-compliance management in the context of the BP management lifecycle.

Interoperability requires full exchange of data, information (contextualized data) and knowledge (actionable information), which ensures that coalition's members will fully collaborate in synchronizing their logistics plans and processes at all echelons. Existing architecture frameworks, such as NATO's Architecture Framework (NAF) and The Open Group architecture Framework (TOGAF), do not support knowledge management, required to process massive amount of data. In order to perform collaborative logistics planning, logisticians and commanders need to access, in a seamless manner, data and information from several domains from systems within the coalition and from external sources such as social media, government and supplier sites, to name a few. The integrated and structured data must then be transformed into information, or contextualized data, and ultimately into actionable information or knowledge.

Ambitious goals, including those set by the European Union, foster the increased use of distributed generation, essentially based on renewable energy sources. This requires major changes in electricity markets and energy systems, namely through the adoption of the smart grid paradigm. The use of simulation tools and the study of different market mechanisms and the relationships between their stakeholders are essential. One of the main challenges in this area is developing decision support tools to address the problem as a whole. This work contributes to increasing interoperability between heterogeneous systems, namely agent-based, directed to the study of electricity markets, the operation of smart grid, and energy management. To this end, this work proposes the use of ontologies to ease the interaction between entities of different natures and the use of semantic web technologies to develop more intelligent and flexible tools. A multiagent systems society, composed of several heterogeneous multiagent systems, which interact using the proposed ontologies, is presented as a proof-of-concept. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,215-226,,,1472 CCIS,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

Though the project focuses on current law production the goal of the portal is to gradually incorporate all legislation issued from the foundation of the Modern Greek state and the publishing of the Government Gazette (1833 onwards). The project had to ensure its compatibility and interoperability with N-lex and EUR-Lex environments and align standards and terminology with its European counterparts as well as to accommodate local needs. The present study provides both the technical as well as the administrative challenges of the project. The case study presents the initial phase of the project and incorporates data deriving from the early implementation stages. The challenges emerging from the over-regulated and fragmented Hellenic legislation are discussed in relation to the technical issues arising from these particular elements. Furthermore, the adaptation of the ontological model (ELI) and the increasing need for securing semantic alignment and thematic specifications are presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,8874-8899,,2,15,,J.

Current research has developed different techniques to achieve effective composition of web services. Unfortunately, they fail to ensure a perfect match in the composition of web services. This paper investigates the composition of web services and how to effectively employ web services in the design activities. Objectives of this work are twofold. Firstly, to proposes a new technique that assists users to resolve a mismatch in the composition of web services. Secondly, to implement, validate, and evaluate the proposed technique within the context of design activities thus establishing a workbench called Service Oriented Design Activities (SODA). SODA provides a web-based design infrastructure that allows loosely coupled design teams to collaborate on different services, and to enable them to resolve any mismatch between heterogeneous design services. Other anticipated advantages include interoperability of design services, improving designer capabilities, and the reduction of product development time. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results. BAO leverages description logic to formalize the domain knowledge and facilitate the semantic integration with diverse other resources. As a consequence, BAO offers the potential to infer new knowledge from a corpus of assay results, for example molecular mechanisms of action of perturbagens. © 2012 Vempati et al.",2012,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,11,7,,PLoS ONE,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,"standardization; Databases, Factual; information system; semantics; article; knowledge base; Internet; information processing; Computational Biology; bioassay ontology; data analysis; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; drug research; drug targeting; high throughput screening; High-Throughput Screening Assays; technology; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 16:00:51,EC3 – Narrow domain specificity

While the automotive industry's demand for electric vehicles increases, sectors like aerospace are also exploring electric applications. However, relying on batteries as the primary power source presents challenges such as high costs, limited availability of raw materials, and safety concerns. Additionally, inconsistent battery usage leads to varying rates of battery degradation, posing further difficulties. This study aims to understand battery degradation in electric aircraft subjected to different battery charging parameters using multi-domain modeling. The long-term goal is to facilitate the commercialization of electric aircraft by making them more economically viable while considering real-world constraints. An open-source multi-domain model built in the MATLAB-Simscape environment provides a robust platform to simulate different flight profiles and track battery degradation in terms of battery capacity. To analyze battery behavior under various conditions, we examined different flight routes characterized by distinct load profiles with varying charging parameters. The analysis focuses on a battery pack composed of Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt cells with a capacity of 260~Ah at 418~V; resulting in a nominal pack capacity of 109~kWh. We evaluated the effects of battery degradation across three flight routes in the southeastern United States under two charging rates: 1.5C and 2C. Results show that charging at 1.5C degrades the battery significantly less than charging at 2C. Additionally, starting flights with an initial state of charge of 80% instead of 100% further reduced battery degradation across all flight routes. Variations in flight route length were found to have a minimum effect. By incorporating battery degradation into smarter route planning, the study offers pathways to improve the sustainability and economic viability of electric aviation. This suggests that careful selection of battery charging parameters can mitigate some of the current limitations of electric aircraft. © 2024 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

With respect to the tendency of business partners to set up their own security islands, e.g. based on isolated Public Key Infrastructures (PKIs), this development introduces a contradiction for collaborative business process.

The proceedings and conclusions from this meeting are presented in the following report. This paper was prepared with the involvement of leading biomedical researchers, computer scientists, engineers, and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) experts. The purpose of this document is to provide a research roadmap towards ""Net-Centric Healthcare"", 1 all the while reconciling with future USAMRMC priorities. In an effort to produce tools that enable/enhance research, education, and direct patient care under the umbrella of the Department of Defense Tricare System, this report concludes with a call for TATRC (and others) to enable Grid technologies via applied research programs for the Military Healthcare Service (MHS). This document serves to communicate expectations and requirements to all parties - end users, policymakers, scientists, as well as technology leaders. The roadmap provides a foundation upon which TATRC may organize its strategic priorities and commit to resource allocations. HealthGrids are computational environments of shared resources in which heterogeneous and dispersed biomedical data is accessed, mined and computed. Advances in computer science allow biomedical researchers to capitalize on ubiquitous & transparent distributed systems and a broad set of tools for resource sharing (computation, storage, data, replication, security, semantic interoperability, and delivery of software as services). The foremost opportunity of the HealthGrid is the creation of a research climate that transforms the biomedical sector into a functional knowledge society, as the contemporary equivalent of the original Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)2 transformed networks to become today's Internet. To synthesize a roadmap from the expertise of the IRT participants, four break-out groups were convened to delineate milestones and estimate requirements necessary to overcome current implementation barriers. A mix of academic, industry and government subject matter experts addressed both technological and socio-political dynamics. The HealthGrid was catalogued into four discrete functions which interoperate: Computation Grids, Data Grids, Knowledge Grids, and Collaboration Grids. The breakout groups mirrored this taxonomy. Systems Medicine provided a framework for the HealthGrid IRT and resultant research roadmap. Contributors worked off the predicate that 'functions of life are mediated by biological networks, and human disease occurs when one or more of these networks become perturbed by genetic mutations and/or abnormal environmental signals'. Systems Medicine is driving development of new in-vivo and in-vitro measurement technologies, which, collectively, in the next 5-20 years, will lead to medical care that is predictive, preventative, personalized and participatory (P4 medicine).4 Grid technologies provide a powerful technology infrastructure and enabler to attain this goal. Derivatively, the HealthGrid aims to foster innovation in how disease is viewed, diagnosed, treated, and prevented. This decade is witness to major revolutions in our comprehension of the human genome, infectious disease, environmental influences, cancer and aging. The advent of electronic health records in combination with Grid technologies and growing interdisciplinary collaborations present the opportunity to participate in new scientific and medical breakthroughs at an ever-accelerating pace, emblematic of our transformation to a 'knowledge society'. This report attempts to refine the broad landscape of the HealthGrid into scalable and 'digestable' targets of opportunity. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

CSV format is simple and practical, but it is difficult to express the relevant metadata such as data provenance, meaning of data fields, relationships between data fields, and user access approaches/rights, etc. In order to make the CSV data semantically structured, interoperable, accessible and reusable for various Web applications, they need to be extracted from the CSV files and converted into the Resource Description Framework (RDF) format that provides superior data assimilation and query functionality. In this paper, we focus on how the Semantic Web technologies are used to convert CSV data into RDF. Therefore, we present a method and techniques to parse the CSV file; the parsed CSV data are complemented with metadata annotations to generate the annotated tabular data model which is then converted into RDF triples. According to the conceptual correspondences between the CSV data model and RDF data model, we designed a set of algorithms to generate RDF triples from the CSV data. Our developed prototype tool, CSV2RDF, is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method through real-world CSV datasets. The implementation and experimental outcomes demonstrate that our pro-posed method is feasible to generate RDF data from CSV datasets, with satisfactory performance on any size of data sets. © 2005 – ongoing JATIT & LLS.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,6889-6902,,20,96,,J.

This paper presents a modified algorithm for dynamic data transformation based on blockchain technology for Master Data Management Systems (MDM), incorporating Ethereum, IPFS and semantic data. Based on the proposed algorithm, an architectural approach is also described that allows developing semantic data management systems. The algorithm assumes data validation, enrichment, and deduplication processes, while also ensuring consistency and trust among multiple participants through the decentralized nature of the blockchain. The semantic data management aspect of the system is achieved using Apache Jena and local ontology, which facilitate semantic interoperability and efficient data processing. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of applying blockchain technology to semantic MDM systems and demonstrates an approach to using the system in Semantic Web, as well as in areas such as finance, healthcare, public administration, and logistics. We evaluated the algorithm using a customer information dataset from an e-commerce platform. The results confirmed the potential of blockchain technology in data management and showed improvements in data accuracy, consistency, completeness, but with some loss in storage efficiency due to the use of blockchain. This paper contributes to developing and evaluating a novel algorithm and architecture, combining blockchain technology, MDM principles, and semantic data management for improving data quality, security, and performance in decentralized systems. However, further research and assessment may be required for the full implementation and evaluation of the system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,555-571,,,14104 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Internet of Things (IoT) services are developed to increase energy efficiency in buildings. The W3C recommends the use of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard to enable IoT interoperability on the Web. However, the ability to discover IoT devices available in the WoT remains a challenge due to the lack of ontologies integrating WoT Thing Descriptions in smart buildings. We present in this paper the domOS Common Ontology (dCO) to achieve the W3C WoT discovery in smart residential buildings in 5 demonstration sites of the H2020 EU domOS project. This ontology integrates the WoT Thing Description with IoT concepts, i.e. IoT devices and building topology, in order to leverage the W3C WoT Discovery.

Yet, most research and policy efforts aimed at understanding the implications of adopting AI tend to prioritize only a handful of ideas; they do not fully connect all the different perspectives and topics that are potentially relevant. In this position paper, we contend that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the 'relational problem' in socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been settled - including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems, and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across fields - consisting of three horizontal domains for grouping relevant concepts and related methods: Operational, Epistemic, and Normative. We first situate this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two premier academic venues, AIES and FAccT, before illustrating how developing suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing relevant concepts in each of these domains. Finally, we outline outstanding questions for developing this relational approach to institutional AI research and adoption. © 2023 ACM.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,512-519,,,,,,,,,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: AIES - Proc.

In most cases, they are not semantically interoperable and a huge human effort is needed to create integrated ontologies and knowledge base for smart city. Smart City ontology is not yet standardized, and a lot of research work is needed to identify models that can easily support the data reconciliation, the management of the complexity and reasoning. In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a big volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to smart-city ontology and stored into an RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries to provide new services to the users. The paper presents the process adopted to produce the ontology and the knowledge base and the mechanisms adopted for the verification, reconciliation and validation. Some examples about the possible usage of the coherent knowledge base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-Store and related services.

Much of the Joint Network Enabled Operations (NEO) development work for the future global aviation system is analogous to the ongoing development of the IOOS. Further, there have been important practical lessons on elements of advocacy, and related coalitions of stakeholders, which support successful outcomes. During 2005, an initial spiral development and demonstration project was conducted by a government and industry team applying a NEO, system-of-systems approach to develop the next generation aviation system. Like IOOS, this work was performed in support of an interagency customer set (in this case the Joint Planning and Development Office representing DOT/FAA, DoD, DHS, NASA, DOC/NOAA.) This project explored current and future operational concepts, architecture definition, information exchange requirements, data standards and protocols, and strategic and tactical-level decision support (with special emphasis on timely, data-driven collaborative decision making for complex operational problems.) The next spiral development project will be planned and executed in 2006 and 2007. An important area of early user engagement in the NEO development work was the exploration of a generalized data model to represent the data for a widely diverse future set of data suppliers and users. For the traditional air traffic domain of the baseline system, an important part of this is the Flight Data Object. For the diverse set of interagency and private sector users and for future aviation system concepts, this baseline was an inadequate data representation. Similarly, the NEO project systems engineering and test bed development is related to ongoing work in standards and protocols (including semantics, data structures) for the IOOS. ©2006 IEEE.",2006,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: OCEANS,,,,Standards; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information theory; Systems engineering; Project management; Network architecture; File organization; Data structures; Mathematical models; Computer networks; Aviation; Chlorine compounds; Equipment testing; Industrial engineering; Information Exchange Requirements; Joint network; NASA; Ocean currents; Problem solving; Spiral developments; Unmanned vehicles; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 16:11:24,EC2 – Tool- or implementation-only focus

Recent work on Digital Twins for Administrative Law (DTAL)[1] suggests that legislation be issued together with machine-readable ontologies and executable logic, yet guidance on how to architect such systems remains scarce. In this work we propose a layered reference architecture that separates (i) the natural-language statute, (ii) a core ontology expressed in OWL, (iii) a configuration layer for mutable policy parameters, and (iv) an executable-rule layer exposed through a RESTful and MCP façade. Grounded in design science research, we implemented a proof-of-concept twin of the Upper-Austrian tourism-levy statute and qualitatively evaluate the twin with legal, software, and public-administration experts.

Taxonomies based on hand made directory hierarchies still remain the only possible alternative for most small and medium enterprises, public administrations and individual users. However, both the limitations of the hierarchical organization of file systems and the difficulty of maintaining the coherence within the taxonomy have raised the need for more scalable and effective approaches. Desktop searching applications provide proprietary interfaces that enable content-based searching at the cost of having no control on the indexing and ranking of results. Semantic file systems, instead, leave users the freedom to manage the taxonomy according to their specific needs, but lose the standard file system features. In this paper we describe GFS (graph-based file system) a new hybrid file system that extends the standard hierarchical organization of files with semantic features. GFS allows the user to nest semantic spaces inside the directory hierarchy leaving unaltered system folders. Semantic spaces allow customized file tagging and leverage on browsing to guide file searching. Since GFS does not change the low-level interface to interact with file systems, users can continue to use their favorite file managers to interact with it. Moreover, no changes are required to integrate the semantic features in proprietary software. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",2017,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,51-55,,,Part F128274,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Integrating knowledge-based artifacts into Decision Support Systems, such as Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DW/BI) systems, can provide new information sources, enable new analytical capabilities, and enhance decision-making. In previous work, the Balanced Scorecard Ontology (BSO) was developed to represent knowledge related to the Balanced Scorecard framework, including its concepts and relationships. The BSO was used to assess strategy formulation, implementation, and execution in a public sector organization, demonstrating its impact on strategy management. However, manual ontology population, especially related to performance indicator values, can lead to challenges in data availability, acquisition frequency, and quality. This paper proposes a semantic approach to integrating, aligning, and ensuring traceability between strategy and DW/BI systems. The Light Data Warehouse Ontology is introduced to represent the DW conceptual and logical models and semantically connect them with strategic information using the BSO. This integration enriches strategy analysis by providing strategic context to the BI environment and enabling automatic retrieval of performance indicator values. The proposed framework improves decision-making efficiency, reliability, and timeliness, providing managers with a data-driven environment aligned with organizational strategy. © 2013 IEEE.",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,163103-163119,,,13,,IEEE Access,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Semantic Web; Ontology; Information use; Decision making; Ontology's; semantic web; Semantic-Web; Balanced scorecard; balanced scorecard ontology; Balanced scorecard ontology; Balanced scorecards; Business intelligence systems; Data quality; Data reliability; Data warehouse/business intelligence system; data warehouse/business intelligence systems; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Decisions makings; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Semantic-Web techniques; strategic management; Strategic management; Strategic planning; LR_Query: Scopus_02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 16:16:58,EC1 – Off-topic

A step-by-step framework for optimal digitisation is proposed, grounded in archival best practice and enriched with artificial-intelligence and semantic-web technologies. Emphasis is placed on semantic data representation, which renders information actionable, searchable, interlinked, and automatically processed. As a proof of concept, a large language model—OpenAI ChatGPT, version o3—was applied to a corpus of narrative police reports, extracting and classifying key entities (metadata, persons, addresses, vehicles, incidents, fingerprints, and inter-entity relationships). The output was converted to Resource Description Framework triples and ingested into a triplestore, demonstrating how unstructured text can be transformed into machine-readable, interoperable data with minimal human intervention. The approach’s challenges—technical complexity, data quality assurance, information-security requirements, and staff training—are analysed alongside the opportunities it affords, such as accelerated access to records, cross-agency interoperability, and advanced analytics for investigative and strategic decision-making. Combining systematic digitisation, AI-driven data extraction, and rigorous semantic modelling ultimately delivers a fully interoperable information environment for law-enforcement agencies, enhancing efficiency, transparency, and evidentiary integrity. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,9,14,,Comput.,,,,,,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Semantic Web; Ontology; interoperability; Public administration; Digitisation; Metadata; Information use; Law enforcement; Advanced Analytics; archive digitization; Archive digitization; artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision making; digital transformation; Digital transformation; Enforcement authorities; knowledge representation; Knowledge representation; Knowledge-representation; law-enforcement authorities; Law-enforcement authority; ontologies; Ontology's; Personnel training; Quality assurance; Security of data; Semantic systems; semantic web; Semantic-Web; SPARQL queries; SPARQL query; LR_Query: Scopus_02,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 16:20:12,EC1 – Off-topic

Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in online catalogues to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Union has developed the Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) as a PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and promote semantic interoperability. The use of CPSV-AP is increasing within the European Union leading to a number of relevant PS descriptions that are also potentially beneficial for the implementation of the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) regulation. However, the use of heterogeneous, some times not very popular technologies (e.g. RDF) to provide access to such data hinders their further uniform exploitation. Towards this problem definition, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can provide a uniform, easily-consumable way of serving such data hiding any heterogeneity of the underlying technologies. The aim of this paper is to design and implement an API to serve data based on CPSV-AP facilitating the implementation of the SDG and the further exploitation of data at added value services and tools e.g. chatbots. The paper describes the requirements, use cases, design choices and implementation details of the API. We anticipate that the proposed API will help towards the further adoption of CPSV-AP by facilitating and homogenizing the consumption of relevant data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,291-304,,,464 LNBIP,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Two frameworks that provide support for the proposed composition method are also described in this paper: Linkedator, which is responsible for connecting entities managed by microservices, and Alignator, which aligns semantic concepts defined by heterogeneous ontologies. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method is based on entity linking principles and uses individual matching techniques considering a formal notion of identity. This method imposes two major constraints that must be taken into account by its implementation: architectural constraints and resource design constraints. Findings: Experiments were performed in a real-world scenario, using public government data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and that, it leverages the independence of development and composability of microservices. Thereby, the data provided by microservices that adopt heterogeneous ontologies can now be linked together. Research limitations/implications: This work only considers microservices designed as data providers. Microservices designed to execute functionalities in a given application domain are out of the scope of this work. Originality/value: The proposed composition method exploits the potential data intersection observed in resource-oriented microservice descriptions, providing a navigable view of data provided by a set of interrelated microservices. Furthermore, this study explores the applicability of ontology alignments for composing microservices. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.",2017,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,302-323,,3,13,,Int.

To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry. We evaluated ResearchFlow on the task of forecasting the impact of research topics on the industrial sector and found that its granular characterization of topics improves significantly the performance with respect to alternative solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,219-236,,,12387 LNAI,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The ontology of war has changed. Preserving the adversarial qualities of democratic societies risks failures of ignorance, exaggeration, and misdirection. Preserving global commons remains essential for security. Design thinking offers tools to explore problems and develop creative solutions. Society itself is both an asset and a potential target for Grey Zone threats. Tools for response depend on greater awareness and investment in information, monitoring, and interagency coordination. Strategies and defensive tools must integrate traditionally separate expertise. Security education should be holistic, preparing the professionals of most countries for cross-domain employment. Military, paramilitary, police, intelligence, and public service, as inverted professions, will require early exposure to each other. Much of the necessary talent will not be in uniform, and civil-military distinctions are increasingly blurred. Breaking rules and playing dirty seems to incur low costs for major powers, and most countries must be ready for these tactics.

Requirements for a decision support system are used as a starting point at its design stage and determine the functions of the developed system without showing the mechanism of its implementation. At the same time, the requirements serve as constraints in the process of system development. The set of the developed requirements for the decision support system includes basic, functional, non-functional and economic requirements. We propose to use the ontological approach in the development of requirements for the system. This allows us to solve a number of problems arising from the description of the requirements in natural language: the lack of exposition clarity, misrepresentation of the requirements and so on. The ontological model allows developers to interpret the requirements in the same way, to structure the specification of requirements for the system and to eliminate blurring in their definitions. Ontological representation of knowledge about requirements for the developed system and about the system providing public services in general is used for the semantic integration of existing information resources, appropriate interpretation of the content of text documents and search queries presented in a natural language. The developed ontology improves the quality of user (stakeholder) interaction during the system operation. In addition, it includes rules for term combination to provide reliable assertions on the state of the decision support system. © 2020 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.",2017,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,36-47,,1,,,Bus. inform.,Разработка требований к системе поддержки принятия решений для оценки качества предоставления государственных услуг с применением онтологического подхода2,,,,,"National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics",,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Basic requirements; Decision support system; Economic requirements; Functional requirements; Non-functional requirements; Ontological model for decision support; Quality assessment of public services provided; System of providing public services; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0,2026-01-21 16:25:18,EC1 – Off-topic

B5G is expected to achieve superior capabilities in ultra-high network transmission speed, low latency, low energy consumption, and high coverage, comparing to current 5G network performance. Although B5G is still in the development and implementation stage, there are many patents and non-patent literature depicting B5G innovative technologies and applications. The landscapes of B5G technologies are great references for governments and industries to understand the advances in mobile communication for R&D strategies. Thus, this research focuses on developing a formal tech-mining workflow integrating semantic-based patent and non-patent literature analysis for ontology building, patent technological topic clustering, and graph convolutional network (GCN) modeling for depicting key technology interactions among clusters of sub-domain topics. This research emphasizes the study of B5G patent landscape and key technology interaction roadmap in comprehensive steps as a valuable reference for B5G mobile network R&D, as well as for conducting tech-mining of other technology domains of interests. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,1,17,,J.

The paper reviews the feasibility of ontology-based spatial resource integration options to combine the core spatial reasoning with domain-specific application models. We propose an ontology-based framework for semantic level communication of spatial objects and application models. We then introduce a multi-agent system, ontology-based spatial information and resource integration services (OSIRIS), to semantically interoperate complex spatial services and integrate them in a meaningful composition. The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. We also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS.

The whole semantic system of this study includes SV, SC, DOC, ISV, and SG. The Semantic Validation technique performs parametric validation, scoring, and threshold comparison to safeguard data integrity, whereas the Semantic Agreement algorithm combines meanings by adding agreement values. Decentralized ontologies are improved using Distributed Ontology Construction to accommodate new meaning linkages. connected Semantic Verification detects semantic meaning compatibility across linked networks. Lastly, meaning Governance enables individuals to decide on recommended meaning modifications without centralization. Comparative analysis examines the framework. Tables and illustrations indicate its dominance over key aspects. The recommended strategy generally outperforms Web3 evolution methods in security, scale, interoperability, user privacy, and government effectiveness. Visualizing the process with pie charts, layered analysis, and temporal trends shows its efficacy. This semantic framework's consistency, correctness, and flexibility are key responses to Web3's changes. The framework's continual refinement methods can shape Web3 Internet semantics as open networks change. This semantic framework helps establish a decentralized and connected Internet as bitcoin and Web3 technologies progress. It also allows Web3-aligned semantic development. © 2024 IEEE.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,1257-1263,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

In addition, malware have become a growing important problem for governments and commercial organizations. The key point of the research on the network security is to judge and validate the similarity metrics among the malicious software. Indeed, most computer network issues are also caused by malware. As a consequence, one enhanced system to analyze the behavior of malwares is needed to try to predict the malicious actions and to minimize the computer damages caused by the malware. However, the conventional data analysis tools lack the ability to deal with the computer safety because the environments malwares operating are with high levels of imprecision and vagueness. For this reason, we have developed Taiwan Malware Analysis Net (TWMAN) to improve the accuracy of malware behavioral analysis. This chapter tries to explorer and deal with these computer security and safety issues by integrating the semantic technologies and computational intelligence methods, such as the fuzzy ontologies and fuzzy markup language (FML). With the proposed approach, the malware identification has achieved a good performance according to the experimental results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,113-132,,,296,,Stud.

While this data influx offers unparalleled insights and connectivity, it also brings significant privacy and security challenges. Existing regulatory frameworks like the United States (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8228, the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to address these challenges but often operate in isolation, making their compliance in the vast IoT ecosystem inconsistent. This paper presents the IoT-Reg ontology, a holistic semantic framework that amalgamates these regulations, offering a stratified approach based on the IoT data lifecycle stages and providing a comprehensive yet granular approach to IoT data handling practices. The IoT-Reg ontology aims to transform the IoT domain into a realm where regulatory controls are seamlessly integrated system components by emphasizing risk management, compliance, and the pivotal role of manufacturers' privacy policies, ensuring consistent adherence, enhancing user trust, and promoting a privacy-centric IoT environment. We include the results of validating this framework against risk mitigation for Wearable IoT devices. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,2897-2906,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Among the intellectual property (IP) assets, the patents have a strategic role because they contain from 70 to 90% of information about technologies. One of the most prominent phases in managing patents is their classification according to a proposed taxonomy, a particularly expensive and time-consuming phase, above all due to the increase in the number of filed patents, the complexity of the contents and the difficulty in classify them in the right category. Users that search for a potentially useful patent, often deal with “monster class”, multidisciplinary categories containing a significant number of poorly characterized and classified patents. Monster categories are thus ineffective, not discriminating, and difficult to explore. A typical example of “monster class” is often present in the healthcare related patents, due to its multidisciplinary and particularly innovative nature. The paper proposes an approach for: i) improving taxonomy-based classification by using Natural Language Processing and clustering techniques; ii) improving keywords-based classifications by using a complex network analysis on the most frequent words. The approach was experimented on Knowledge-Share platform (an Italian patent platform) with a particular attention on patent related to healthcare 4.0 with the aim of identifying the technology trends in this cross-domain context, where artificial intelligence is identified to be having an impact, such as in robotic assisted surgery, personalized medicine, drug discovery, imaging & diagnostic, diseases monitoring, assisted living, automated clinical decision support, elderly care, and so on. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,131-143,,,,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

This would provide clinicians (A Clinician is a healthcare professional who deals directly with a patient, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, specialists and first responders.) with a holistic view of all patient data. Combined with increases in patient data generated by advances in medical devices, it allows the extract of more information increasing recall, but it requires great cognitive effort to identify relevant information. This additional effort will exasperate the impact of the trend of decreasing time clinicians have to interact with their patients. It raises the risk to clinicians of cognitive overload. This paper proposes a solution that presents clinicians with the most relevant patient healthcare data based on the clinicians role and the healthcare scenario. The goal is to provide the clinician a more efficient method to determine the proper treatment. This proposal is applicable to current scenarios where the key relevant data is readily available. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,606-616,,,227,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

REACH is an acronym for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals. Under REACH, the authorities have the task of assessing chemical substances, especially those that might pose a risk to human health or environment. The work under REACH is scientifically, technically and procedurally a complex and knowledge-intensive task that is jointly performed by the European Chemicals Agency and member state authorities in Europe. The assessment of substances under REACH conducted in the German Environment Agency is supported by the knowledge-based system KnowSEC, which is used for the screening, documentation, and decision support when working on chemical substances. The software KnowSEC integrates advanced semantic technologies and strong problem solving methods. It allows for the collaborative work on substances in the context of the European REACH regulation. We discuss the applied methods and process models and we report on experiences with the implementation and use of the system. © 2016 Baumeister et al.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,1,8,,J.

Here, we present the BioAssay Ontology (BAO), which enables the categorization of biological assays by concepts relevant to interpret and compare HTS data and thus facilitates data analysis across many HTS campaigns. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository. PubChem. Here we demonstrate how BAO can be applied to access and analyze HTS data.

To address this, innovative strategies like Next-Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) are being explored, integrating historical animal data with new mechanistic insights from non-animal New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). This paper introduces the TOXIN knowledge graph (TOXIN KG), a tool designed to retrieve toxicological information on cosmetic ingredients, with a focus on liver-related data. TOXIN KG uses graph-structured semantic technology and integrates toxicological data through ontologies, ensuring interoperable representation. The primary data source is safety information on cosmetic ingredients from scientific opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety between 2009 and 2019. The ToxRTool automates the reliability assessment of toxicity studies, while the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation standardizes chemical identification, enabling in silico prediction of repeated-dose toxicity via the implementation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Toolbox (OECD QSAR Toolbox). The ToXic Process Ontology, enriched with relevant biological repositories, is employed to represent toxicological concepts systematically. Search filters allow the identification of cosmetic compounds potentially linked to liver toxicity. Data visualization is achieved through Ontodia, a JavaScript library. TOXIN KG, filled with information for 88 cosmetic ingredients, allowed us to identify 53 compounds affecting at least one liver toxicity parameter in a 90-day repeated-dose animal study. For one compound, we illustrate how TOXIN KG links this observation to hepatic cholestasis as an adverse outcome. In an ab initio NGRA context, follow-up in vitro studies using human-based NAMs would be necessary to understand the compound's biological activity and the molecular mechanism leading to the adverse effect. In summary, TOXIN KG emerges as a valuable tool for advancing the reusability of cosmetics safety data, providing knowledge in support of NAM-based hazard and risk assessments.

This study addresses the issue of sudden crowd surges caused by large-venue events by developing a predictive Big Data framework that integrates Wi-Fi sensing data, event schedules, and meteorological variables to forecast foot traffic. The study focuses on Sendagaya, Tokyo, an area that hosts multiple large-capacity venues. Using Random Forest regression, we evaluated our model that incorporates event and weather data and compared it with our baseline model, which uses only temporal features. Our results indicate that while temporal data alone yield stable predictions, incorporating event-specific and weather-related factors enhances the prediction accuracy of foot traffic peaks during large events.

CMSs offer various advantages, like separation of data structure from presentation and variety in user roles, but also present certain disadvantages, like inefficient keyword-based search facilities. The new generation of content management solutions imports the notion of semantics and is based on Semantic Web technologies, such as metadata and ontologies. The benefits include semantic interoperability, competitive advantages and dramatic cost reduction. In this paper a leading Enterprise CMS is extended with semantic capabilities for automatically importing and exporting ontologies. This functionality enables reuse of repository content, semantically-enabled search and interoperability with third-party applications.

This paper presents the SMART-MANAGER IT platform, a multitenant, multi-user system designed to address the complexities of centralized CPE management using the TR-069 protocol. The platform integrates the open source GenieACS server with a middleware layer that enhances interoperability through the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology. Key features include real-time device monitoring, efficient data processing, advanced security mechanisms (JWT and RBAC), and customisable dashboards tailored to different user roles. In a production environment, the system demonstrated remarkable scalability and performance, successfully managing 5,000 devices with minimal latency (average 25 ms) and maintaining stability under high load. The proposed architecture significantly reduces operational costs for small ISPs while ensuring seamless CPE management. This makes it a practical and scalable solution for large-scale IoT ecosystems. Future work will focus on integrating the TR-369 protocol to support next-generation device management and further enhance system capabilities. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2025.",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,144-150,,4,2025,,,,,,,,Institution of Engineering and Technology,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: IET.

Such a complex framework tends to increase multi-level governance in the period 2007-2013, promoting a wider participation of stakeholders (including Public Administration, Local Communities, Enterprises, etc). This process has been usually accompanied by e-tools for the management of bottom-up processes, with several instances related to common problems of participation processes. Communication between "" programmer"" and categories of beneficiaries always presented weakness due to the ineffective system of management knowledge within the process. Relevant issues in the framework of regional development programmes are: Do stakeholders understand the meaning of general and sectoral policies? Are citizens aware of technical instruments implementing such policies? Are they conscious of ex-ante comprehensive context analysis and/or can they share possible future scenarios? A way to tackle these problems is the use of ontologies.In this work we present the structural elements of the ontology of regional development programmes analyzing major steps of the ontology design and nodal phases of the ontology building (i.e. consensus on relations and restrictions, switch from glossary to taxonomy). The result of such an application is an ontology of regional development. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2011,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,243-254,,PART 2,6783 LNCS,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.
