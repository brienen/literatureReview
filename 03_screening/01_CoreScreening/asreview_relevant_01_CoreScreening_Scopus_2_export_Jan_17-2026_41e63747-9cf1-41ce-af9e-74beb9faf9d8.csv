The research systematically investigates the challenges and limitations of existing solutions for semantic interoperability. Furthermore, the concept of canonical evidence is introduced as a tool for the cross-border exchange of structured data automatically with less ambiguity and in compliance with the legal requirements of the selected public services. A design science research approach in an agile set-up is applied in the artefact (canonical evidences) development process. The requirements are elicited based on eight case studies set up in the context of the EU initiative, Digital Europe for all (De4a). The data models developed in this study are in compliance with the requirements and provisions of a selected set of EU member states. The outcome of the study includes eleven evidence types that could be reusable in executing procedures of respective e-Government services. © 2022 Owner/Author.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 08:09:22,,131-139,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

We use this knowledge base to demonstrate realistic integration queries in egovernment and academic scenarios. In order to support Hawkeye, we extended DLDB with additional reasoning capabilities. At present, the Semantic Web consists of numerous independent ontologies. We demonstrate that OWL can be used to integrate these ontologies and thereby integrate the data sources that commit to them. In terms of performance, we show that the load time of our system is linear on the number of triples loaded. Furthermore, we show that many complex queries have response times under one minute, and that simple queries can be answered in seconds. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",2007,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,1115-1124,,PART 2,4806 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

It also facilitates the mobility of citizens and businesses within the European Union through legal and effective EU-wide evidence. However, despite the existence of several semantic standards, a lack of an ontology for EU-wide evidence persists, primarily due to the low level of EU harmonisation of information that may prove compliance with procedural requirements. Building EU-wide evidence involves several cross-border communities of practice, composed of experts with different technical, legal, organisational, semantic, idiomatic and cultural backgrounds, spanning various public administration levels and sectors. This diversity introduces a range of cross-border, socio-technical challenges that have not been directly addressed in existing literature or by European projects and initiatives. Based on the lessons learned from the Digital Europe for All (DE4A) large-scale pilot project, the DE4A EU-wide OOP Semantic Elicitation Framework (DEOSEF) is proposed to guide business and semantic experts in the elicitation of EU-wide evidence for target public services, through a collaborative, context-aware, and iterative agile process involving diverse communities of practice. This paper presents DEOSEF as a foundational step for future initiatives involving a combined semantic elicitation-creation of EU-wide evidence. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,4,6,,Digit.

We aim to describe the semantic layer that was designed in the scope of the SPOCS project to enable the validation of documents in the scope of cross border procedures. The SPOCS project (Simple Procedures Online for Cross- Border Services)1 focuses in particular on the transfer of documents to European administrations in the scope of procedures to deliver services across borders. One of the problems that arise is the heterogeneity of documents between countries even they have the same role. With the increase of cross border activities encouraged by the service directive in particular, electronic procedures are more important than ever. The project has therefore set up an infrastructure including the transfer of documents in a metadata container and the validation of documents. Cross-border service pilots have been implemented to show the added value of the SPOCS infrastructure. To overcome the problem of semantic equivalence of documents, the European Commission has encouraged the implementation of a semantic layer to support the interoperability between administrative systems and the reuse of resources across government bodies. In the scope of the SPOCS project, we have implemented a set of pilots to illustrate the added value of implementing a semantic interoperability layer and developing common models and vocabularies. Common ontologies have been designed to describe documents, equivalences, and procedures. Specific access mechanisms have been implemented to automatically verify the status of European companies. Finally, semantic rules have been created to determine the procedure that needs to be used in order to provide a cross border service.

Based on the Bologna process and the European higher education area, learning mobility has been successful under Erasmus and other similar initiatives. However, a key issue for students and universities is that a significant amount of time is spent on the manual labour involved in the process of applying to degree programs overseas. It is therefore essential for higher education institutions to better exploit the potential of technology and Web 2.0 to enable a secure exchange of evidence during application for degree programs and academic courses in foreign Higher Education Institutions, as well as applying for study grants and obtaining recognition for academic and other types of studies. Harmonisation of the student data is a key initial step for enabling such exchange. In this study, an approach to a secured exchange of education evidence is instrumented under the H2020 project Digital Europe for All (DE4A). Existing semantic standards for Web 2.0 applications, core vocabularies for public service data and semantic assets from existing best practices such as W3C, ISA2 core vocabularies, and Europass data model are used to curate data models that allow the exchange of a higher education diploma, secondary education diploma and information of special needs (disability, large family), which is required by students when requesting study grants (waive of tuition fees). The semantic interoperability agreements are established cross-border through these data models called canonical evidences. The canonical evidences are tested with the national data services of three countries, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. The final data models are implemented in XML Schema format that could be used by any educational organisation intending to use trusted public service databases within Europe to automatically retrieve information on students’ degrees. The validity of the canonical evidences is tested on two pilot occasions within the DE4A project. The outcome of this study summarises the procedural requirements for evidences when applying for a higher degree program and seeking grants. Furthermore, it resulted in verified canonical evidence data models that fulfil the procedural requirements for applying for studying abroad. © 2021 Academic Conferences Limited.

These included different data policies, encodings, formats and semantics, to name a few. Data was collected for, and applied to, domain specific use cases and comprehensive standards did not exist, all impacting on the re-usability of such public sector data. To release the potential of spatial data held by public authorities and improve evidence-based environmental policy making, action was needed at all levels (Local, Regional, National, European) to introduce more effective data and information management and to make data available for citizens’ interest. The INSPIRE Directive, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, directly addresses this set of problems. The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007, with full implementation in every EU Member State required by 2021. It combines both, a legal and a technical framework for the EU Member States, to make relevant spatial data accessible and reused. Specifically, this has meant making data discoverable and interoperable through a common set of standards, data models and Internet services. The Directive’s data scope covers 34 themes of cross-sector relevance as a decentralised infrastructure where data remains at the place it can be best maintained. A great deal of experience has been gained by public administrations through its implementation. Due to its complexity and wide scope, this is taking place in a stepwise manner, with benefits already emerging as important deadlines approached. Efficient and effective coordination are following the participatory approach established in its design. It is timely to reflect on 10 years of progress of the “cultural change” which the European Spatial Data Infrastructure represents. We therefore, consider the lessons INSPIRE is offering for those interested in joined-up and federated approaches to geospatial data-sharing and semantic interoperability across borders and sectors. The approach itself is evolving through this experience. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,63-84,,,2019,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The implementation of cross- border exchange of IPS is among the highest priorities of the European commission. Detailed functional requirements and use cases have been elaborated in addition to a new IPS standard in recent years as part of the efforts for enabling interoperability in information exchange and continuity of care. This paper presents a practicable approach and a solution to the problem of achieving semantic interoperability among the IPS sources in the European union. A novelty approach in this paper is first to design and analyze the business process of the primary use case and after that to propose a solution. It allows to identify several activities that are out of the scope in the existing documents and at the same time require special attention at the stage of software implementation. The proposed solution makes use of the openEHR information model to represent the IPS standard dataset in terms of archetypes. This way we preserve the semantic context in clinical concepts as well as introduce interoperability among data providers. Moreover, it overcomes the severe drawback of the message paradigm, where every two communicating parties must apply transformation of existing data that is specific to their needs. The discussion considers a computer experiment with real data employing a fully functional web application for IPS cross-border exchange. © Proceedings of the 12th IADIS International Conference e-Health 2020, EH 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

Special emphasis of data and language heterogeneity specifically is given to the integration of community data within the higher infrastructure levels. The existing 34 data themes needed for environmental applications are referenced in Annexes I, II and III of the INSPIRE directive. The framework for the implementation is given by key components specified through technical implementing rules. The rules enable sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organizations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across the European Union. For selected municipal data themes, the relation with the implementing rules will be investigated. The considerations are guided by the objectives of searchability, usability, reusability, composability and interoperability of digital data. Based on the current situation in the context of geographic information, data transformation and the usage of standards of the semantic web and ontologies to solve heterogeneity problems in data management are discussed. Cases of interoperability at the semantic, syntactic, and organisational level as well as results of data transformation and cartographic enhancement of local government data within the European spatial data infrastructure will be illustrated in the paper.

A novelty in this approach is the management of native XML instances of an archetype concept in the CEN 13606 standard by means of a native XML database and XML technologies. The computer experiments demonstrate that it is suitable for representing relatively small clinical datasets such as those describing rare diseases like the Acromegaly illness, where the semantic context in the relatively small number of symptoms is practicable to tag in terms of SNOMED-CT terminology codes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the semantically enriched information model can facilitate secondary use of clinical data by visualizing the execution of queries based on standard terminologies. Finally, the compatibility of the information model with the IPS standard enables sharing of clinical data among different information models. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.",2020,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,552-556,,,270,,,,,,,,IOS Press Nieuwe Hemweg 6B Amsterdam 1013 BG,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Stud.

PMKI aims to share maintainable and sustainable Language Resources making them interoperable in order to support language technology industry, and public administrations, with multilingual tools able to improve cross border accessibility of digital services. The paper focuses on the main feature (interoperability) that represents the specificity of PMKI platform distinguishing it from other existing frameworks. In particular it aims to create a set of tools and facilities, based on Semantic Web technologies, to establish semantic interoperability between multilingual lexicons. Such task requires to harmonize in general multilingual language resources using standardised representation with respect to a defined core data model under an adequate architecture. A comparative study among the main data models for representing lexicons and recommendations for the PMKI service was required as well. Moreover, synergies with other programs of the EU institutions, as far as systems interoperability and Machine Translation (MT) solutions, are foreseen. For instance some interactions are foreseen between PMKI and MT service provided by the EC but also with other NLP applications. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

So far, the agency relied on traditional application-centric approaches to support the data exchange among multiple actors interacting within the railway domain. This lead however, to isolated digital environments that consequently added barriers to digital interoperability while increasing the cost of maintenance and innovation. In this work, we show how Semantic Web technologies are leveraged to create a semantic layer for data integration across the base registries maintained by the agency. We validate the usefulness of this approach by supporting route compatibility checks, a highly demanded use case in this domain, which was not available over the agency’s registries before. Our contributions include (i) an official ontology for the railway infrastructure and authorized vehicle types, including 28 reference datasets; (ii) a reusable Knowledge Graph describing the European railway infrastructure; (iii) a cost-efficient system architecture that enables high-flexibility for use case development; and (iv) an open source and RDF native Web application to support route compatibility checks. This work demonstrates how data-centric system design, powered by Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles, provides a framework to achieve data interoperability and unlock new and innovative use cases and applications. Based on the results obtained during this work, ERA officially decided to make Semantic Web and Linked Data-based approaches, the default setting for any future development of the data, registers and specifications under the agency’s remit for data exchange mandated by the EU legal framework. The next steps, which are already underway, include further developing and bringing these solutions to a production-ready state. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,648-664,,,12922 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Ontology is an explicit specification of conceptualization. It defines the terms with specified relationships between them, and can interpret by both humans and computers. Currently, E-Government is facing several problems relating for integration of the information systems, extraction, and representation across heterogeneous organizations. In Addition, e-government is the civil and political conduct of the government, which involves using information and communication technologies (ICT). Therefore, e-government services need to provide information where format and methods of delivery adapt according to the users and situations. In recent years, semantic Web technologies based on ontology have brought about promising solutions to the above engineering problems. In this paper, we propose a semantic-based framework for e-government. In addition, the platform Protégé for semantic ontology development is introduce. We proposed ontological model for the Education ministry domain and Medicine ministry domain. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) represents this ontology, which is the standard language for the semantic web. Moreover, it was testing in proposed semantic framework. The ontology will be useful in the knowledge of the e-government semantic integration, and semantic Web applications. © 2005 - ongoing JATIT & LLS.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,2557-2566,,9,96,,J.

The domain ontology is created using ontology knowledge-based editor Protégé and OWL-Viz. Thus facilitating to improve the knowledge sharing so that citizens can take more knowledge benefits from the e-government sharing. In addition, the ontology will be useful in the knowledge sharing of semantic e-government integration, and semantic Web applications.

Thereafter, a semiformal representation of the domain ontology is created with the ontology knowledge-based editor Protégé. Finally, the OWL ontology model is imported. This study aims at providing e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world, with an easy-to-use framework for practising semantic knowledge representation in e-government processes, thus facilitating the design of e-government systems that can be easily integrated and maintained. The other challenge when integrating information systems in any domain such as e-government is the challenge of interoperability. One can distinguish between three levels of interoperability: technical, semantic, and organisational.

However, few of the potential service integration applications have been adopted by governments to increase the accessibility of and satisfaction with government services and information for citizens. Recently, the 'life event' concept was introduced as the core element of integrating complexity of service delivery to improve the efficiency and reusability of e-government services, web-based information management systems. In addition, a semantic web-based ontology is considered to be the most powerful conceptual approach for dealing with challenges associated with developing seamless systems in distributed environments. Among these challenges are interoperability, which can be loosely defined as the technical capability for interoperation. Despite the conceptual emergence of semantic web-based ontology for life events, the question remains of what methodology to use when designing a semantic web-based ontology for life events. This paper proposes a semantic web-based ontology model for life events for e-government service integration created using a methodology that implements the model using the ontology modelling tool Protégé and evaluates the model using Pellet Reasoner and the SPARQL query language. In addition, this model is illustrated by two examples, the Saudi Arabia King Abdullah Scholarship and Hafiz, to show the advantages of integrated systems compared with standalone systems. These examples show that the new model can effectively support the integration of standalone e-government services automatically so that citizens do not need to manually execute individual services. This can significantly improve the accessibility of e-government services and citizen's satisfaction. © 2014-IOS Press.",2014,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,189-205,,3,8,,Intelligent Decis.

These databases often run in heterogeneous hardware and software environments and use different, project-specific data models. These conditions lead to a high degree of autonomy but to an increasing heterogeneity. The heterogeneity then leads to the problem that these databases cannot be easily merged into a federated database system (FDBS). In general, a FDBS integrates multiple autonomous database systems into a single FDBS. The challenge is now to merge multiple heterogeneous systems into one FDBS to provide successful federated searches. Here, the term successful means that the results of a search query are correctly and completely answered by all integrated domain-specific database systems. In addition to delivering correct and complete results from these queries, semantically and syntactically correct mappings of various database schemes must be ensured. We argue that at the faculty of the Humanities, a cross-domain use of autonomously developed databases offers added value in terms of data analysis and evaluation. Hence, the challenge that exists is to develop a suitable federated database infrastructure that supports the development of autonomous information systems, while heterogeneity does not increase. To meet this challenge, in IT projects in the defense sector and in the public administration of the federal government, the V-model is a mandatory procedural standard to develop IT systems systematically. When developing a cross-domain information system, special attention should be paid to the development of variants, i.e. the project-specific information systems, so that the extension of the federated infrastructure at the faculty is guaranteed and can be maintained in the long term. In the area of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) variant modeling is a very current topic and no standard exists. However, there are some approaches that can be used, such as the method Variant Modeling with SysML (VAMOS). VAMOS is characterized by its ease of use to model variants and can be combined very well with other methods. In this paper we present a model-based approach to develop a federated database infrastructure for supporting the usability of a cross-domain information system. For the development of a federated database infrastructure we present how the V-model can be combined with the VAMOS method using the tool Cameo Systems Modeler for modeling and simulating in general, the broker-based SysML Toolbox for simulating database interactions, and the database management system Heurist for creating a cross-domain information system. © 2022 IEEE.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: SysCon - Annu.

Government Institutions have developed various applications providing public or inter-governmental services. These E-Government applications, some are legacy applications, were built independently using different platforms. Consequently, this heterogeneity creates problems such as lack of data integration and system interoperability. This integration/interoperability problem makes it difficult to perform semantic linking between databases to create a government knowledge base which is critical for knowledge discovery and innovation. Ontology has been regarded as a promising technology to solve this integration/interoperability problem as it provides semantic interoperability and promotes knowledge discovery and innovation.

Thus, for modelling semantically the public services, we have adopted semantic web services (SWS) technology. However, this technology allows only semantic description of services without giving a cognitive semantic representation of them. It allows modelling the relationships between services with their different situations through conceptual structures (CSs). In this paper, we develop an approach for modelling efficiently the public services based on SWS and CSs technologies. For this purpose, we extend OWL-S ontology with an e-government knowledge represented through a set of ontologies. Besides OWL-S ontology, we use the conceptual graphs theory as implemented in AminePlatform for structuring and organising the cognitive knowledge about services. Thus, for our application domain, that is, 'e-customs', we extend this platform to support simultaneous use of multiple domain-specific ontologies. Our approach enables as well enhancing service discovery and composition. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",2014,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,59-82,,1-2,11,,Electron.

However, e-government systems along with heterogeneous databases have created difficulties in interoperability. These heterogeneous databases lead to data redundancy, data inconsistency, and difficulty to integrate data and process data among agencies. The representation of heterogeneous systems through common standards and vocabularies is considered a valuable solution for interoperability. In this paper, an ontology-based framework for Bhutan's e-government is proposed to support semantic interoperability. To evaluate the framework, the domain ontology for Bhutan's Administrative Division, namely BTNAD is developed and discussed. BTNAD Ontology has been implemented and verified using Protégé, and its practical usage has been validated by checking against the defined competency questions and the corresponding SP ARQL query implementation. The presented study can clearly demonstrate the Single Source of Truth (SSOT), hence enabling the data reusability and collaboration, and interoperability within and across the agencies. Finally, the research discusses some recommendations from the proposed framework and interoperability challenges. © 2022 IEEE.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Int.

They have inestimable value in economic development, social operations, and strategy. However, due to the lack of effective application of knowledge management technology, government information resources are locked in archive records, making it difficult to achieve knowledge organization and interoperability. Based on the theories and methods of the semantic web and semantic ontology construction, we summarize the relevant domain knowledge of government archives and construct the Chinese Government Archive Ontology (GAO) with the collection of government archives as the data. The ontology model implements the semantic interoperability between government archives and performs knowledge representation and reasoning on their content. We define the classes and properties of GAO, describe its creation process in detail, and demonstrate its applicability in practice through SPARQL query and event logical representation based on the 5W1H framework. GAO is capable of realizing linked data and discovering the knowledge hidden behind the policies of various agencies and departments, which can serve scientific decision-making and the economic society, regulate institutional powers, and further promote the research and practice of archival science in the digital age. © 2013 IEEE.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,130199-130211,,,9,,IEEE Access,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Ontology; Decision making; Knowledge representation; Semantic interoperability; Knowledge management; semantic ontology; Digital storage; Government archives; Government departments; Government information; Knowledge management technology; Knowledge organization; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Logical representations; Protégé; RDF schemas; Scientific decisions; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 09:39:00,

The lack of common data standards (common data models and reference data) for exchanging information between administrations in a cross-domain and/or cross-border setting stands in the way of digital public services and automated flow of information between public administrations. Core data models address this issue, but are often created within the closed environment of a country or region and within one policy domain. A lack of insight exists in understanding and managing the life-cycle of these initiatives on public administration information systems for data modelling and data exchange. In this paper, we outline state-of-the-art implementations and vocabularies linked to the core data models. In particular we inventoried and selected existing core data models and identified tendencies in current practices based on the criteria creation, use, maintenance and coordination. Based on the analysis, this survey suggest research directions for policy and information management studies pointing to best practices regarding core data model implementations and their role in linking isolated data silos within a cross-country context. Finally we highlight the differences in their coordination and maintenance, depending on the state of creation and use. © 2016 ACM.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,327-337,,,01-03-March-2016,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Governments are typically in charge of publishing these datasets, but they typically employ disparate data formats (sometimes proprietary ones) and published datasets are commonly disconnected from other sources, including previous versions of such datasets. As a result, the usage of forestry data is very challenging, especially if we need to combine multiple datasets. Methods and results: Semantic Web technologies, standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have emerged in the last decades as a solution to publish heterogeneous data in an interoperable way. They enable the publication of self-describing data that can easily interlink with other sources. The concepts and relationships between them are described using ontologies, and the data can be published as Linked Data on the Web, which can be downloaded or queried online. National and international agencies promote the publication of governmental data as Linked Open Data, and research fields such as biosciences or cultural heritage make an extensive use of Semantic Web technologies. In this study, we present the result of the European Cross-Forest project, addressing the integration and publication of national forest inventories and land cover maps from Spain and Portugal using Semantic Web technologies. We used a bottom-up methodology to design the ontologies, with the goal of being generalizable to other countries and forestry datasets. First, we created an ontology for each dataset to describe the concepts (plots, trees, positions, measures, and so on) and relationships between the data in detail. We converted the source data into Linked Open Data by using the ontology to annotate the data such as species taxonomies. As a result, all the datasets are integrated into one place this is the Cross-Forest dataset and are available for querying and analysis through a SPARQL endpoint. These data have been used in real-world use cases such as (1) providing a graphical representation of all the data, (2) combining it with spatial planning data to reveal the forestry resources under the management of Spanish municipalities, and (3) facilitating data selection and ingestion to predict the evolution of forest inventories and simulate how different actions and conditions impact this evolution. Discussion: The work started in the Cross-Forest project continues in current lines of research, including the addition of the temporal dimension to the data, aligning the ontologies and data with additional well-known vocabularies and datasets, and incorporating additional forestry resources. © © 2024 Giménez-García, Vega-Gorgojo, Ordóñez, Crespo-Lera and Bravo.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,7,,Front.

The importance of achieving syntactic as well as semantic interoperability – as a result of transforming heterogeneous sources into Linked Data – is discussed: semantic interoperability is solved at data level in order to ease further development on top. We present a comprehensive data model for smart cities that integrates several data sources, including, geo-referenced data, public transportation, urban fault reporting, road maintenance and municipal waste collection. We show some novel ontology design patterns for modeling public transportation, urban fault reporting and road maintenance.

Geospatial data, which give location information for geographic features, are pervasive across many disciplines and fundamental for diverse applications, such as economic development, natural resources, environmental protection, and emergency response. But, re-using geospatial data remains difficult because of its heterogeneity. Although progress has been made by initiatives such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and Geospatial One-Stop to distribute data, it is now necessary to address issues of standards harmonization and agreement on the meanings of relevant concepts in diverse data sets due to different community views. The lack of semantic interoperability has been recognized as a stumbling block to collaboration. As a solution, well designed, formal ontologies, relying on agreements between communities on unambiguous representation of concepts and relationships for a given problem area, can be used as an analytic tool to bridge community gaps. The purpose of this INTEROP project is to create opportunities for the geospatial community to work on semantic agreements and use semantic mappings and other emerging Semantic Web technologies. An initial INTEROP Network is based on the existing SOCoP network that has a core group of active participants from academia, government, and industry. We now want to broaden the Network to cover various domains and include more participants.

We present a smart urban fault reporting web platform to help citizens in reporting common urban problems, such as street faults, potholes or broken street lights, and to support the local public administration in responding and fixing those problems quickly. The tool is based on a semantic data model designed for the city, which integrates several distinct data sources, opportunely re-engineered to meet the principles of the Semantic Web and linked open data. The platform supports the whole process of road maintenance, from the fault reporting to the management of maintenance activities. The integration of multiple data sources enables increasing interoperability and heterogeneous information retrieval, thus favoring the development of effective smart urban fault reporting services. Our platform was evaluated in a real case study: a complete urban reporting and road maintenance system has been developed for the municipality of Catania.

There are various urban geographic information system projects that have been produced by local governments all over the world. However, there are technical difficulties, a lack of spatial data standards and specific policies governing geographic information system projects. The result of the current situation is that the process of data collection is sometimes inefficient and the quality of the data may be inadequate. Furthermore, there are problems with managing projects and sharing data. The key to resolving these problems is to develop a harmonised geographic information model for the urban governance of Turkey. The model should fulfill the application-driven geographic data needs of local governments and support decision-making processes at regional and national levels. The domain model is an object-relational model and the starting point for creating sector models. The generic conceptual model components were defined to harmonise geographic data and to produce data specifications. In order to enable semantic interoperability unified modelling language has produced the application schemas for data themes such as administrative unit, address, cadastre/building, hydrographic, topography, geodesy, transportation, and land cover/use.

For the geospatial domain common models such as INSPIRE have been established in the European Union. The United Nations initiative on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) draws together national and regional capacities. Interoperability is the main principle behind these initiatives. Nonetheless there is a lack of published research to date on mapping agency geospatial linked data leveraging the UN-GGIM taxonomy of information management data themes. Thus, we have identified use cases and defined a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)[3] taxonomy expressing the UN-GGIM data themes for national spatial infrastructure. This has been applied in a metadata generation and reporting tool for Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) which underpinned improved governance and reporting infrastructure in OSi. This demonstrated the contribution of Semantic Web technology to spatial data governance as well as its importance for data publishing. This paper presents a documented open license SKOS taxonomy for the UN-GGIM data themes that follows Linked Data best practices.

CSI-Piemonte, as ICT body of the Local Public Administration, manages a great deal of data, both alphanumeric and geographic, which altogether represent a wide set of detailed description of the regional data patrimony. According to the document European Interoperability Framework (EIF), interoperability consists in the ability from part of systems ICT and supported processes to exchange data and to share information and knowledge. In particular EIF identifies three fundamental levels of interoperability to consider: organizational interoperability, semantic interoperability and technical interoperability. In this perspective the so-called semantic interoperability has a fundamental role. The definition of semantic interoperability to the inside of the document is following: ""Semantic Interoperability is concerned with ensuring that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose. Semantic interoperability enables systems to combine received information with other information resources and to process it in a meaningful manner."" According to the perspective of the semantic interoperability, it's not to characterize reusable data formats, but to comprise, to make exploitation, to connect between the various shadings of meant that these assume in the practical one of the administrative procedures, to the aim to render the effective composition and unification of various services possible. The technology key in order to face this problem is today that one of the so-called ontologies, data structures that they describe the meant one of the terms uses you from a computer science application or an organization so that the computers (but also the men) can reason on the relations between such terms, characterizing similarity and differences of meant. Data and service requests are currently generated and managed in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, different actors (e.g., service providers, product sellers, governmental organizations) need to exchange data in a wealth of different formats. To allow an effective information exchange, systems need to support interoperability, thus enabling the sharing of information and knowledge. To this end, a general-purpose exchange data model needs to be defined. The following described experiences propose a conceptual box contaning: - in the lower parts, metadata and data of portal objects - in the upper parts, conceptual data models (""light"" ontologies) Semantics criteria extracts knowledge from lower parts, light ontologies validates knowledge. Upper intelligence increments lower intelligence, and viceversa. This generalized methods allows knowledge reuse, experimented with Central Public Administration vs. Local Public Administration. Any kinds of light ontologies, in coherence with lower level, can infer and reuse knowledge, for example also for other European Public Administration.",2010,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,614,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.,,,,Interoperability; Semantics; Public administration; Metadata; Information exchanges; Semantic interoperability; Computer software reusability; Interoperability framework; Technical interoperability; Organizational interoperability; Birds; Management; Administrative procedures; Conceptual data models; Information technology; Science applications; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 10:01:29,

To handle this challenge, data models are typically developed to characterize and manage the data generated, used, and stored by a given enterprise. Unfortunately, different data providers employ qualitatively different data models, and this gives rise to problems exchanging data across organizational boundaries. Over the past decade, these problems have motivated data producers and consumers to look toward standardized data exchange models to address data interoperability. In this paper we examine some of these standardized data exchange models and compare them with a new type of data model based on ontologies. Ontology models have emerged in recent years from a confluence of research in the artificial intelligence, semantic web, and information science communities. This paper introduces ontology models, provides several use cases for ontologies relevant to aviation data management, and summarizes state-of-the-art aviation prototype applications that utilize ontologies. © 2016 IEEE.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,2016-December,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc,,,,Interoperability; Ontology; Information management; ontologies; Electronic data interchange; Data interoperability; data interoperability; Government agencies; State of the art; Data structures; aviation data management; Avionics; Data exchange models; data models; Data producers; Digital avionics; Model-based OPC; Organizational boundaries; Service provider; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 10:02:14,

If the existing information is not shared among the organizations that hold it, the alternative is to develop the necessary capabilities to acquire, store, process and manage it, which will lead to duplicated costs, especially unwanted if governmental organizations are concerned. The European Commission has elected IS among public administrations as a priority, has launched several IS initiatives, such as the EUCISE2020 project within the roadmap for developing the maritime Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), and has defined the levels of interoperability essential for IS, which entail Semantic Interoperability (SI). An open question is how can IS performance be managed? Specifically, how can IS as-is, and to-be states and targets be defined, and how can organizations progress be monitored and controlled? In this paper, we propose 11 indicators for assessing SI that contribute to answering these questions. They have been demonstrated and evaluated with the data collected through a questionnaire, based on the CISE information model proposed during the CoopP project, which was answered by five public authorities that require maritime surveillance information and are committed to share information with each other. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

However, as the closed-worlds of ES are opened to Internet scale data sources, there is an emerging need to better understand the semantics of such data and how they can be integrated. Foundational ontologies can help establish this understanding and therefore, there is a need to investigate how such ontologies can be applied to underpin practical ES integration solutions. This paper describes research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of such an approach through the development and application of the 4D-Semantic Extract Transform Load (4D-SETL) framework. 4D-SETL was employed to integrate a number of large scale datasets and to persist the resultant ontology within a prototype warehouse based on a graph database. The advantages of the approach included the ability to combine foundational, domain and instance level ontological objects within a single coherent system. Furthermore, the approach provided a clear means of establishing and maintaining the identity of domain objects as their constituent spatiotemporal parts unfolded over time, enabling process and static data to be combined within a single model. © © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

From a circular economy compliance monitoring perspective, beyond the access to mandatory data that governments will receive, authorities may benefit from accessing additional business data from the source on a voluntary basis, which is challenging. While platforms and data spaces solve a great deal of complexity and interoperability within their realm, platform, and data space interoperability is still challenging. In the logistics domain, efforts have been made to overcome these issues of data sharing across logistics platforms with a Semantic data sharing architecture developed by the CEF FEDeRATED Action, at the heart of which is a semantic model aligning other semantic models for logistics. In this paper, we take the Semantic data sharing architecture as a point of departure and examine the opportunities and limitations that it has for CE monitoring, and how it relates to other developments in the EU and beyond. Many of these developments acknowledge the need for data access across heterogeneous systems and – processes of actors; others add security and trust to data sharing that goes all the way to the level to cover legal obligations. The goal of this paper is to gain further insights into how data sharing across multiple platforms and data spaces enables circular economy monitoring, where government organizations would need to address the issue of how they would interface with, and access data that resides in multiple platforms and data spaces. We found that the various models can be aligned on some architecture principles that promote interoperability across dimensions (e.g. federation, keeping data at the source), yet they still differ on other dimensions (e.g. data model and semantics, as well as how they address issues of identification, authentication and authorization). We suggest further efforts towards developing meta-level agreements and standardization for data space interoperability and we propose further research directions on that topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,332-351,,,921 LNNS,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Within European data spaces, high priority is given to adherence to FAIR data principles. Thus, data and services should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Ontologies as semantic models are fundamental in achieving semantic interoperability, as they provide a common framework for data and service access, discovery, understanding and reuse. However, the inherent complexity of data space initiatives, coupled with their underlying domains diversity are key challenge facing optimal FAIRness. This motivates the need for an agile methodology that aligns with data space principles, integrates existing domain standards, consolidates the use of metadata for ontology’s FAIRness, and engages various involved actors (domain experts, data service providers, ontology engineers) towards the development of common data space ontology. In the frame of the OMEGA-X project, aiming to build an energy data space, this paper presents AIME, an ontology development methodology integrating the reuse of both standards and reference ontologies to enable the development of modular ontologies for data spaces. It leverages agile principles to strengthen communication between various stakeholders through different steps: reference standards and ontologies selection, selection of use cases, design and selection of interaction models capturing data exchanges, ontology modules creation, automation and continuous integration features to support the entire original ontology engineering phase and reuse by data space users. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2024,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,3882,,,,,,,,CEUR-WS,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.,,,,Ontology; Ontology's; Data space; Data consistency; Agile developement; Development methodology; European standards; European Standards; FAIR principle; FAIR principles; Interaction modeling; Modular ontologies; Ontology development; Ontology Engineering Methodologies; Ontology engineering methodology; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,"Oliveira, I.; Barcelos, P.P.F.; Calhau, R.; Fonseca, C.M.; Righetti, G.; De Giorgis, S.; Sacco, G.; Hedblom, M.M.; Kutz, O.; Glauer, M.; Stappel, M.; Trojahn, C.; Poveda-Villalon, M.; Garijo, D.; Bernabe, C.H.; Lin, A.Y.; Compagno, F.; Fensel, A.; Terkaj, W.; Adamo, G.; Dooley, D.; Kumpel, M.; Bordea, G.; Warren, R.; Sehar, A.; Lange, M.; Bindt, F.; Toxopeus, I.; Audrito, D.; Grasso, F.; Nai, R.; Sulis, E.; Beverley, J.; Jensen, M.; de Cesare, S.; Gailly, F.; Guizzardi, G.; Partridge, C.; Partridge, C.; Pastor, O.; Castro, A.G.; Hubauer, T.; Suess, W.; Schmurr, P.; Willis, M.; Santamaria, D.F.; van Ede, T.; Klein, D.; Engelberg, G.; Engelberg, G.; Castiglione, G.; Bella, G.; Continella, A.; Lanti, D.; Mosca, A.; Scafoglieri, F.M.; Xiao, G.; Kutt, K.; Fernandez-Breis, J.T.; Pichler, A.; Palko, G.; Nalepa, G.J.; Garbacz, P.; Pergl, R.; Khan, Z.C.; Barcelos, P.P.F.; Moreira, J.; Barton, A.; Sanfilippo, E.M.; Daniele, L.; Almeida, J.P.A.; Franconi, E.; Johannesson, P.; Ghidini, C.; Zamborlini, V.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 10:08:34,

Data service is a critical component for OGD which guarantees the availability of government data to users in the form of structured and machine-readable open datasets. Aspects such as usability, quality, and interoperability should be considered in building such open datasets. The diversity of data sets usually hampers unlocking the full potential value of data. Interoperability addresses the ability of open data platforms and data services to communicate, exchange and consume data, and to operate effectively together. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based technique enabling governmental organizations to identify their public data and publish them via well-defined interoperable data services. In this context, an Open Governmental Data Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) is designed and developed to fulfill this goal. As a case study, the constructed platform has been utilized and evaluated in the Tehran Municipality organization.

Fostering smart city innovation at local and regional level requires a set of mature technologies to discover, integrate and harmonize multiple data sources and the exposure of effective applications for end-users (citizens, administrators, tourists..). In this context, Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data principles provide a means for sharing knowledge about cities as physical, economical, social, and technical systems, enabling the development of smart city services. Despite the tremendous effort these communities have done so far, there exists a lack of comprehensive and effective platforms that handle the entire process of identification, ingestion, consumption and publication of data for Smart Cities. In this paper, a complete open-source platform to boost the integration, semantic enrichment, publication and exploitation of public data to foster smart cities in local and national administrations is proposed. Starting from mature software solutions, we propose a platform to facilitate the harmonization of datasets (open and private, static and dynamic on real time) of the same domain generated by different authorities. The platform provides a unified dataset oriented to smart cities that can be exploited to offer services to the citizens in a uniform way, to easily release open data, and to monitor services status of the city in real time by means of a suite of web applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,171-176,,,10546 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Complexity, cross-cutting nature, diversity of data sets, interoperability and quality issues usually hamper unlocking the full potential value of data. To tackle these challenges, this paper aims to provide a novel solution using a top-down approach. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a systematic ontology-based approach combined with a novel architecture and its corresponding processes enabling organizations to carry out all the steps in the OGD value chain. In addition, an OGD Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) are developed to showcase the proposed solution. Findings: The efficiency and the applicability of the solution are evaluated by a real-life use case on energy consumption of the buildings of the city of Tehran, Iran. Finally, a comparison was made with existing solutions, and the results show the proposed approach is able to address the existing gaps in the literature. Originality/value: The results imply that modeling and designing the data model, as well as exploiting an ontology-based approach are critical pillars to create rich, relevant and well-described OGD data sets. Moreover, clarity on processes, roles and responsibilities are the key factors influencing the quality of the published data services. Thus, to the best of the knowledge, this is the first study that exploits and considers an ontology-based approach in a top-down manner to create OGD data sets. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,110-127,,1,16,,Trans.

The FED4IoT project is a research and innovation project that aims to develop a smart-city application, named 'VirIoT,' which realizes the semantic interoperability of IoT data among numerous IoT applications from different grounds. To realize the semantic interoperability of IoT data, data management on cloud platforms, such as FIWARE, is considered necessary. Therefore, the development of a root data domain gateway (RDG), which analyzes IoT data, converts its data format, and posts the data to the cloud service, is required. In this project, Kanazawa Institute of Technology has chosen wildlife monitoring as one of the use cases of the project, and its system using IoT has been designed and developed.

Consequently, the necessity of establishing a government knowledge management system, so as to speed up information lookups, sharing, and linkups, naturally arises. Moreover, this knowledge management system would in turn enhance e-government effectiveness as it helps to store and transmit information, be it explicit or implicit in nature. The first step in creating this knowledge management system is to build up the government ontology and thesaurus. Upon the completion of the ontology and thesaurus needed, semantic searching can be conducted, which in turn kickstarts other mechanisms required for effective information management.

The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European Union to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme ""Horizon 2020"" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights. We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information. Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation. © Willi Egloff et al.",2014,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,109-135,,414,,,ZooKeys,,,,,,Pensoft Publishers info@pensoft.net Geo Milev Street 13a Sofia 1111,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Biodiversity knowledge; Data use agreement; European copyright; European database protection right; Intellectual property rights; Open Access to data and information; Taxonomy; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 10:21:20,

However, the high sensitivity of the clinical domain and the vast differences in eHealth systems pose a great interoperability challenge for solutions that rely solely on prior knowledge of common interoperability standards will not sufficiently scale. This chapter presents a service-based approach that utilises domain ontologies combined with extensible problem models, enriched with domain terminology and knowledge services to enable autonomous data governance and semantic interoperability. The chapter addresses the resulting requirements and proposes a solution outlining the results from the prototype of the approach. © 2012 by IGI Global.

An efficient land administration system is supposed to orchestrate these registries for crossborder and cross-sector land administration services. The recent developments in Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Data approach provide an efficient and flexible solution for web based integration of datasets recorded in these registries. The mentioned registries were specified according to different data models and standards which lead to interoperability problems. The concerned public organisations therefore need a common data model that clearly identifies the recording units of these registries and their core attributes, as well as relationships between them. The present research responds to this requirement by developing a common vocabulary, a Core Immovable Property Vocabulary, as an extension to the e-Government Core Vocabularies (version 1.0) issued recently by the European Commission (EC). The Core Immovable Property Vocabulary is developed by simplifying and capturing the minimal characteristics of complex domain standards and data specifications, thereby enabling a plain representation of immovable property units and their core attributes that are needed for land administration processes. It thus allows for the publication of land administration data sets within the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and renders the integration of land administration datasets with other registries such as address and civil registries encoded according to the e- Government Core Vocabularies. The vocabulary is the result of an individual research effort, carried out by the authors of the present article, and has recently been hosted by the EC ISA (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administration) Joinup platform as a semantic asset (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/cipv/description). The main contribution is the introduction of the Linked Data approach to the land administration domain which may make land administration data sets more accessible via the Web. © 2015 Survey Review Ltd.",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,49-60,,340,47,,Surv.

On the other hand, issues like service, data and process integration have been researched by the Semantic Web community for several years now, and in the last two to three years we have witnessed the first applications of semantic technologies in real, operational e-government systems in both Europe and the US which address exactly these challenges. With this book, the editors present the latest research results on how to use semantic technologies in order to improve or even revolutionize the use of ICT in public administration systems. The contributions are organized into three parts: architectures and process integration, ontologies and interoperability, and portals and user interactions. They give a broad overview of how semantic technologies have been applied in different e-government projects funded from the European program for ICT Research and Development, and they cover a wide spectrum of semantic technologies such as development of domain and service ontologies, semantic enhancements of business process models, semantic Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) based on Semantic Web Services (SWS) frameworks, and ontology-based knowledge management. In this volume, researchers of Semantic Web technologies will find a wealth of challenging real-world scenarios to stimulate new fields of research, while developers of e-government systems as well as other stakeholders in public administration will appreciate the detailed presentations and discussions of numerous applications in areas such as e-government portals, personalization of Web-based public services, or integration and orchestration of public administration processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",2010,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,1.0,,,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Semantic Technol. for E-Gov.

In BRITE, ontologies are seen as a key instrument and technology to dissolve administrative, technical, cultural and lingual barriers of BRs on one hand, and as means to provide semantic interoperability on the other hand.

However, while digitizing public services processes for Moroccan administrations, the designers of information systems record the entered data in databases, without being too interested in the meaning of the entries made by citizens nor on the benefit of exchanged information between public administrations. This causes inconsistency and lack of interoperability between public administration systems. Moreover, the systems require information collection and shared knowledge based on a common vocabulary of public services in Morocco. For this purpose, this paper presents an ontology model based on the 5w1h Method for defining the public services domain. This PSOM ontology is based on the referential defined by the Moroccan Ministry of Administration Reform and Public service. Indeed, we have collected the different concepts related to this field and all possible relationships between them in order to ensure interoperability between all government entities. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Boundaries between public and private services are blurring, enabling government and private sector to collaborate and share responsibilities. In Belgium, the regional Government of Flanders embedded the re-use of public sector information in its legislation and published a data portal containing well over 4000 Open Datasets. Due to a lack of interoperability, interconnecting and interpreting these sources of information remain challenges for public administrations, businesses and citizens. To dissolve the boundaries between the data silos, the Flemish government applied Linked Data design principles in an operational public sector context. This paper discusses the trends we have identified while ‘rewiring’ the Authentic Source for addresses to a Linked Base Registry. We observed the impact on multiple interoperability levels; namely on the legal, organisational, semantic and technical level. In conclusion Linked Data can increase semantic and technical interoperability and lead to a better adoption of government information in the public and private sector. We strongly believe that the insights from the past thirteen years in the region of Flanders could speed up processes in other countries that are facing the complexity of raising technical and semantic interoperability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,86-101,,,55,,J.

At the same time citizens expect that these governmental levels adopt a user-centric approach and provide instant access to their data or to open government data. Therefore the applications at various government levels need to be interoperable in support of the 'once only-principle': data is inputted and registered only once and then reused. Given government budget constraints and the cost and complexity of (re)modeling, translating and transforming data over and over, public administrations need to reduce interoperability costs. This is achieved by semantically aligning information between the different information systems of each government level. Semantical interoperable systems facilitate citizen-centered e-government services. This paper illustrates how the Open Standards for Linked Organizations program (OSLO) paved the way bottom-up from a broad basis of stakeholders towards a government-endorsed strategy. OSLO applied a generic process and methodology and provided practical insights on how to overcome the encountered hurdles: political support and adoption; reaching semantic agreement. The lessons learned in the region of Flanders (Belgium) can speed-up the process in other countries that face the complexity of integrating information intensive processes between different applications, administrations and government levels.",2016,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,126-134,,,22-23-November-2016,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

The models help define structures of knowledge components and their relationship among them within a problem domain that may provide better representation of a system design architecture. Such basic model of knowledge components can provide a transparent approach for enhancing design thinking and comprehension for both users and system developers. This makes the ontology technique as one of the prominent techniques for designing system solution in a context-sensitive manner. In this paper, we describe the use of ontology in two design cases for representing the problem universe of discourse. First design case is on a record management system and second case is on a decision support system. For both system design cases, the ontology technique provided benefits for gaining semantic integration and interoperability in designing the solutions. Findings from our studies suggest that ontology enables provisions both to end users and to system developers for achieving design goals that in turn maximize various user benefits. © 2016 IEEE.",2017,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,148-153,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Semantic assets and the agreements associated with them are essential elements for organisations to understand the meaning of the information they exchange - without them this information would be of little use. In this paper, semantic assets are defined as ontologies, data models, data dictionaries, code lists, XML and RDF schemas which are used for information exchange and that can be reused by implementers of Information Systems, in particular, as part of machine-to-machine interfaces. However, field research has shown that developers, practitioners and researchers working in the field of semantic interoperability in eGovernment tend to reinvent the wheel and semantic assets are rarely reused. In order to encourage and bootstrap the reuse of semantic assets in the EU and beyond, this paper introduces two important initiatives driven by the ISA Programme: the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) and the ADMS-enabled federation of semantic asset repositories on Joinup.

The move toward a global information infrastructure for biobanking demands semantic interoperability through harmonized services and common ontologies. To tackle this issue, the Minimum Information About BIobank data Sharing (MIABIS) was developed in 2012 by the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure of Sweden (BBMRI.se). The wide acceptance of the first version of MIABIS encouraged evolving it to a more structured and descriptive standard. In 2013 a working group was formed under the largest infrastructure for health in Europe, Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-ERIC), with the remit to continue the development of MIABIS (version 2.0) through a multicountry governance process. MIABIS 2.0 Core has been developed with 22 attributes describing Biobanks, Sample Collections, and Studies according to a modular structure that makes it easier to adhere to and to extend the standard. This integration standard will make a great contribution to the discovery and exploitation of biobank resources and lead to a wider and more efficient use of valuable bioresources, thereby speeding up the research on human diseases.

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate, how semantic tools have been used to establish such platform. Semantic tools include thesauri. The Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus (CaLAThe) was issued in 2011 and based on the then draft version of the ISO LADM standard. CaLAThe was further developed to include also terms of the OGC LandInfra standard of 2016. The recent version (December 2019) integrates code list names and values, reflecting both the relevant Survey and Land division parts of LandInfra and, as proof of concept, some of the code lists mentioned in the Annex J Code lists of LADM. CaLAThe thus constitutes a shared universe of discourse, a frame for joint management of the code lists of the mentioned standards. Taking a problem-based approach to the design of artefacts like standards, the mentioned alignment of standards is part of a problem hierarchy. In this hierarchy, development of information standards provides a means for improving public administration, more specifically its aspects of e-government and interoperability. These aspects have spurred interest in semantic tools; for example, standardization organizations have recently publicized their terminological resources in terms of the ISO/TC211 Geolexica glossary and the OGC Definitions Server. The definitions of CaLAThe and the mentioned code lists are by December 2019 included into the OGC Definitions Server. Besides servicing the Land Administration communities, CaLAThe illustrates the use of thesauri as a cross-domain means for supporting the alignment of standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,104,,Land Use Policy,,,,,,Elsevier Ltd,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; knowledge; Alignment of standards; cadastre; Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus (CaLAThe); E-government; ISO LADM; Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS); land management; land tenure; OGC LandInfra/InfraGML; public administration; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 11:32:20,

So to simplify data access, the virtual integration of heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed data sources is required based on the couple mediator-wrapper and founded on ontologies that provide a consensual terminology. The mediator masks the heterogeneity and distributes the data sources, while the adapter accommodates queries to data sources formats.

This study explored the semantic web and ontology used to enhance e-government services. It found that improving ontology for searched and information retrieval processes could help computers retrieve accurate results, improve interoperability and integration, and provide a knowledge base for terms used in building databases and applications. However, more research is needed to effectively integrate ontology into existing systems and extend these approaches to real-world contexts.

However, less attention is paid on methodological issues of ontology development in this domain. These are not sufficiently solved. Existing approaches in ontology development are technically very demanding and require long learning curve and are therefore inefficient for this purpose. E-government domain ontologies could be efficiently developed by domain experts rather than ontology engineers. The paper proposes a novel ontology development methodology for construction of light-weight domain ontologies by bringing ontology modeling closer to domain experts that are actual domain knowledge holders. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by development of a network of e-government domain ontologies used for achieving semantic interoperability of state information systems (IS) in Estonia. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2011.",2011,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,1-13,,,353,,,,,,,,Springer New York LLC,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,,,,Interoperability; Ontology; Semantics; Semantic interoperability; Domain ontologies; Ontology development; Ontology model; e-government; E-government; Ontology networks; Domain experts; Domain knowledge; Electronic commerce; Learning curves; Ontology development methodology; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,"Skersys, T.; Butleris, R.; Nemuraite, L.; Suomi, R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-17 11:42:36,

The e-government effort in many countries has provided a platform for government entities and their business partners to exchange data through Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and standards such as RosettaNet (B2B data exchange standard), EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport), XML (Extensible Markup Language) and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). However, e-government efforts have not really resolved data heterogeneity problems significantly due to limitation of these standards. One such limitation is the inability of data inheritance. In order to solve this problem with emphasis on Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web Services, a semantically enriched web service for the public sector is needed. Thus we propose an ontology-based solution which allows data inheritance and polymorphism. This goal of this paper is to show how heterogeneous e-government documents can be semantically matched. We propose a shared hierarchical knowledge repository approach and a detailed process methodology for semantic mediation. A two-part semantic mediation approach using SRS (Semantic Relatedness Scores) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is highlighted. Both measures are complimentary and provide the semantics necessary for resolving schema heterogeneity. Our approach incorporates a rule-based engine that reads and executes SWRL rules (i.e. RacerPro). We also adopted several tools for proof-of-concept such as Protege (i.e. ontology editor) and JESS (Java Expert Shell System). © 2008 Universidad de Talca-Chile.",2008,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,52-63,,3,3,,J.

The potential benefits of open government data are numerous and include increasing transparency and accountability, enhancing citizens' quality of life, and boosting innovation. However, realizing these benefits is not always straightforward, as the usage of this raw data often faces challenges related to its format, structure, and heterogeneity which hinder its processability and integration. In response to these challenges, we propose an approach to maximize the usage of open government data and achieve its potential benefits. This approach leverages knowledge graphs to extract value from open government data and drive the construction of a knowledge graph from structured, semi-structured, and non-structured formats. It involves the extraction, transformation, semantic enrichment, and integration of heterogeneous open government data sources into an integrated and semantically enhanced knowledge graph. Learning mechanisms and ontologies are used to efficiently construct the knowledge graph.

The semantic interoperability of Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) requires rich and well-defined metadata, as well as the establishment of standards, in order to be able to connect and link these scattered legal data resources. This is usually achieved through the transformation of legal information into structured format and through the utilization of legal ontologies whose main purpose is to connect the legal basis of two or more countries by allowing for reusability and the ability to adequately represent legal information, which is understood and retrieved across borders. Within the context of this study, the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and Akoma Ntoso (AKN) ontologies are mapped in order to make legal data compatible and reusable in as many contexts as possible and to support the Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) concept. The mapping of these two widely used legal ontologies was evaluated by domain experts and strongly validated by tools. The usefulness of the produced mapping is proven through its real-life context application, although one thing to consider regarding possible future perspectives, could be the inclusion and mapping of more legal ontologies to expand the application domain and improve the semantic interoperability of legal information. These mappings could be either achieved using similar methodological approaches or applications of automated and AI-based ontology mapping techniques. © 2023 Owner/Author.",2023,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,41-53,,,,,,,,,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Due to rapidly development of open data, e.g. geographic, track, dynamic geospatial data, governments are required to release more and more data for academics and industry. The ubiquitous data are in various types and formats, e.g. number, graphic or specific format provided by different data sources, in distributed environment. All makes it difficult to integrate data to different domain. This paper proposes a data-flow integration mechanism with a unified description for distributed and heterogonous open data. Our approach starts with using Semantic Web technology and web ontology language (OWL), to define a data flow-oriented semantic description model. This supports a domain view description which is a user's aspect of domain. In this model, users are able to describe a domain view via three main components: 1) data unit, 2) link unit, and 3) domain unit. Final, we use earthquake disaster event as our example depict how the data flow-oriented semantic description model work conceptually. And our solution ensures data interoperability and provides a unified semantic description model to integrate heterogeneous data. © 2015 IEEE.",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,274-278,,,,,,,,,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,"Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

Mostly, different aspects of semantic interoperability have been addressed, which distinguished these artefacts from each other. But on the other hand, all these artefacts have one characteristic in common: they are big, complex,complicated, not easy to understand for people who are not familiar with the concepts and technology of the Semantic Web, and (sometimes) not easy to integrate into legacy systems. But this is crucial in the context of public administration, because there are small- and medium-sized public authorities, e.g., municipalities with limited resources, as well as big and advanced public authorities with a sufficient amount of resources, but existing information systems that cannot be replaced easily, e.g., because they are customized to local needs. In this work in progress paper the question is posed, how the technology regarding the facilitation of semantic interoperability can be simplified, so that these concepts and technology are first of all more understandable to employees and second easier to implement in small- and medium-sized public authorities like municipalities. A deliberation on this question promises the possibility, that the barriers for using these concepts and technology in municipality can be reduced and, that the municipalities can take advantage of these concepts and technology.

Therefore business metadata must be produced and maintained along with the regular business objects, to enable effective information exchange. In that sense, when entities of this domain engage in exchanges of information, it is helpful for those involved if also the metadata produced can be exchanged, which requires it to be commonly understood. This research proposes a Canonical Data Model that supports semantic interoperability in the Portuguese public administration, by defining a set of metadata elements for describing records. The proposed solution is compared against other related data models, and its qualities are assessed using the Bruce-Hillman metadata quality framework.

As new capabilities and assets become available and as current Command and Control (C2) systems become older, border control practitioners are faced with the increasing challenge of how to integrate new assets, command and control all of them in a coordinated and coherent way without having to invest in a completely new C2 systems built from the ground up. Therefore, and bearing in mind that the systems already developed up to date are very old and are not framed in a global standard data model, it has been identified, on one side the need to define a platform that allows to interact with multiple UxVs (land, sea and air), and on the other, unify all data models so that it can globalize and generate a much more concise analysis of what happens in places of conflict. © 2021. by the authors.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,6,16,,Int.

Bringing together different environmental datasets to confidently enable integrated analysis requires reference to common standards and definitions, which are frequently lacking in environmental data, due to the broad subject area and lack of metadata. Automatic inclusion within datasets of controlled vocabulary concepts from publicly available standard vocabularies facilitates accurate annotation and promotes efficiency of metadata creation. To this end, we have developed a thesaurus capable of describing environmental chemistry datasets. We demonstrate a novel method for tagging datasets, via insertion of this thesaurus into a Laboratory Information Management System, enabling automated tagging of data, thus promoting semantic interoperability between tagged data resources. Being web available, and formatted using the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) semantic standard, this thesaurus is capable of providing links both to and from other relevant thesauri, thus facilitating a linked data approach. Future developments will see extension of the thesaurus by the user community, in terms of both concepts included and links to externally hosted vocabularies. By employing a Linked Open Data approach, we anticipate that Web-based tools will be able to use concepts from the thesaurus to discover and link data to other information sources, including use in national assessment of the extent and condition of environmental resources. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,103-110,,1,8,,Earth Sci.

To address this problem, an important industry initiative called ""integrating the healthcare enterprise (IHE)"" specified the ""cross enterprise document sharing (XDS)"" profile. In the IHE XDS, healthcare enterprises that agree to work together form a ""clinical affinity domain"" and store healthcare documents in an ebXML registry/repository architecture to facilitate their sharing. The affinity domains also agree on a common set of policies such as coding lists to be used to annotate clinical documents in the registry/ repository and the common schemes for patient identification. However, since patients expect their records to follow them as theymove from one clinical affinity domain to another, there is a need for affinity domains to be federated to enable information exchange. In this paper, we describe how IHE XDS can be enhanced to support federated clinical affinity domains. We demonstrate that federation of affinity domains are facilitated when ontologies, rather than coding term lists, are used to annotate clinical documents. Furthermore, we describe a patient identification protocol that eliminates the need to keep a master patient index file for the federation. © 2007 IEEE.",2007,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,213-221,,2,11,,IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,"Interoperability; Semantics; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document exchange; Semantic interoperability; eHealth; article; information retrieval; European Union; data base; organization and management; methodology; Database Management Systems; Hospital data processing; Information Storage and Retrieval; medical record; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; computer interface; User-Computer Interface; Automatic indexing; Clinical affinity domain; Clinical document sharing; Cross enterprise document sharing; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; integrated health care system; Integrating the healthcare enterprise; Patient identification; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-21 09:56:55,

Sources of data relating to land use in the UK have been surveyed. The Crop Map of England (CROME) is produced annually by the UK Government and was identified as a valuable source of open data. Formal ontologies to represent land use and the geospatial data arising from such surveys have been developed. The ontologies have been deployed using a high-performance graph database. A customized vocabulary was developed to extend the geospatial capabilities of the graph database to support the CROME data. The integration of the CROME data into the Universal Digital Twin is demonstrated in two use cases that show the potential of the Universal Digital Twin to share data across sectors. The first use case combines data about land use with a geospatial analysis of scenarios for energy provision. The second illustrates how the Universal Digital Twin could use the land use data to support the cross-domain analysis of flood risk. Opportunities for the extension and enrichment of the ontologies, and further development of the Universal Digital Twin are discussed. © The Author(s), 2022.

They are at the interface between human and natural systems. From this perspective, natural hazards are a multidimensional domain including environmental issues, the private and public sector and citizens and governance ranging from local to supranational. The vast amount of information and data necessary for comprehensive hazard and risk assessment present many challenges regarding the lack of accessibility, comparability, quality, organisation and dissemination of natural hazards spatial data. In order to mitigate these limitations, an interoperability framework has been developed and published in the INSPIRE Data Specification on Natural Risk Zones—technical guidelines (DS) document. This framework provides means for facilitating access, integration, harmonisation and dissemination of natural hazard data from different domains and sources. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the paper highlights the key aspects of the interoperability to the various natural hazard communities and illustrates the applicability of the interoperability framework developed in the DS. And secondly, the paper “translates” into common language the main features and potentiality of the interoperability framework of the DS for a wider audience of scientists and practitioners in the natural hazard domain. In this paper, the four pillars of the interoperability framework will be presented. First, the adoption of a common terminology for the natural hazard domain will be addressed. A common data model to facilitate cross-domain data integration will then follow. Thirdly, the common methodology developed to express qualitative or quantitative assessments of natural hazards is presented. Fourthly, the extensible classification schema for natural hazards developed from a literature review and key reference documents from the contributing community of practice is discussed. Furthermore, the applicability of the interoperability framework for the various stakeholder groups is illustrated. This paper closes discussing main advantages, limitations and next steps regarding the sustainability and evolution of the interoperability framework. © 2015, The Author(s).",2015,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,1545-1563,,3,78,,Nat.

Many of these efforts, however, have focused narrowly on technical hurdles while ignoring the social and political contexts that influence interoperability decisions. This article illustrates how social factors influence interoperability along three axes: classification, ontologies of data models, and government policy. Extant research approaches to interoperability of GIS are discussed and their strengths and weaknesses assessed. The article begins with definitions of what interoperability is, why it is important to academic users and policy makers, and its influence on geographical knowledge in a digital age. Exploration of social influences, as an alternative analytical approach to interoperability, begins with a discussion of the roles of classification and scale. The dangers of maintaining inflexible ontologies associated with specific data models are illustrated as a technical limitation with profound social implications for the construction of knowledge. Finally, policy at the multiple levels of governance with respect to interoperability is explored as an infrastructural constraint - and a diminishing influence.",2005,2026-01-17 07:02:49,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,47-61,,4,40,,Cartographica,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Semantic interoperability; GIS; Data standardization; perception; social theory; Spatial databases; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-21 10:10:23,

Here we picked up three vocabularies issued by Japanese government with respect to food security, namely the Agricultural chemical use reference, the Agricultural chemical residue reference, and the Food composition database, since food security is the primary concern of all food chain stakeholders including farmers and consumers. As the result of comparative analysis of these vocabularies, we defined the concept of crop as the botanical information such as the scientific name of species with additional information such as edible parts, cultivation methods and usage. According to the definition, we investigated these three vocabularies and identified 1,249 crops with unique names. The element of CVO contains the information about the crop itself such as synonym, English name and scientific name as well as links to names in the above-mentioned vocabularies and other external vocabularies such as Wikipedia, AGROVOC and NCBI Taxonomy. We develop web-based API for CVO and an application for the farm management as an example. The value of CVO as a core vocabulary in the field of agriculture is identified by compatibility with existing vocabularies and its usefulness is demonstrated by web services applications developed based on CVO. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",2018,2026-01-17 07:02:48,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,320-335,,,11341 LNCS,,,,,,,,Springer Verlag service@springer.de,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

An important challenge towards that end is definitely the development of effective market mechanisms and regulations that will comprise the operational framework of the market. Equally important, however, we consider the development of an interoperability framework that will enable the effective and unproblematic interaction between the market participants at both human and system level. Towards that direction we propose in this paper the Electricity Market Ontology (ELMO), an ontological model that provides a shared, common understanding of concepts and procedures regarding the electricity market operation.

BIM provides the capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity, and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas, such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability. These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European Interoperability framework and develop BIM Interoperability Model with factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and legal interoperability in intra –organizational AEC units, inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes, and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project delivery well informed, more structured, and effective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2021,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,,,,129,,Comput Ind,,,,,,Elsevier B.V.,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,Interoperability; Semantics; Architectural design; Information systems; Building Information Modelling; Interoperability framework; Information theory; Data interoperability; BIM adoption; BIM interoperability adoption model (BIAM); Building information modelling (BIM); Collaborative projects; Comprehensive assessment; Cost reduction; Electronic government; Interoperability dimensions; Interoperability modeling; Traditional architecture; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,2026-01-21 15:56:46,

The researchers selected 14 libraries from national libraries, academic libraries, government libraries, public libraries, multi-national libraries, and cultural heritage centers currently developing Library Linked Data (LLD) schemas. The choices of models, schemas, and elements used in each library's LD can create interoperability issues for LD services because of substantial differences between schemas and data models evolving via local decisions. The researchers observed that a wide variety of vocabularies and ontologies were used for LLD including common web schemas such as Dublin Core (DC)/DCTerms, Schema.org and Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as deprecated schemas such as MarcOnt and rdagroup1elements. A sharp divide existed as well between LLD schemas using variations of the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR) data model and those with different data models or even with no listed data model. Libraries worldwide are not using the same elements or even the same ontologies, schemas and data models to describe the same materials using the same general concepts. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This results in potential data management issues, such as redundancy and write errors. While efforts to standardize data exchange date back to the 90 s, with formats like STEP and IFC, the challenge of interoperability remains. It’s important therefore to set up integrated management systems and interoperable cloud-based technologies. The rise of open semantic standards by W3C and other organizations in recent decades has been significant, but a cohesive connection between different ontologies is necessary for the realization of Digital Twin technology, which represents the life cycle of a building, not just the design phase. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in the building industry, this work focuses on developing a data management methodology for the use and management of existing real estate assets by public administrations, with emphasis on integrating BIM models with existing asset databases using semantic web technologies like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL.

However, implementing City Information Modeling (CIM) faces significant challenges across technical, data-related, organisational, security, and privacy domains, hindering interoperability and effectiveness. This study proposes a Unified City Information Modeling (UCIM) framework as a comprehensive solution to standardise and harmonise data streams and operational processes within smart city ecosystems. Integrating Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and Semantic Interoperability Framework (SIF), UCIM bridges gaps between city management systems, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration across sectors such as transportation, healthcare, energy, and public services. The framework will enhance data exchange and system integration, support informed decision-making and resource optimisation, and pave the way for resilient, efficient, and sustainable urban development. This research underscores UCIM's potential to transform urban management practices and recommends further exploration through practical case studies to validate its application in diverse urban settings. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2025,2026-01-17 07:02:47,2026-01-17 07:09:03,,95-104,,,591 LNCE,,,,,,,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,English,,,Scopus,,,,Journal Abbreviation: Lect.
