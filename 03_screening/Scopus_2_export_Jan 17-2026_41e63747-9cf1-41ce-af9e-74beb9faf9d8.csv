It also facilitates the mobility of citizens and businesses within the European Union through legal and effective EU-wide evidence. However, despite the existence of several semantic standards, a lack of an ontology for EU-wide evidence persists, primarily due to the low level of EU harmonisation of information that may prove compliance with procedural requirements. Building EU-wide evidence involves several cross-border communities of practice, composed of experts with different technical, legal, organisational, semantic, idiomatic and cultural backgrounds, spanning various public administration levels and sectors. This diversity introduces a range of cross-border, socio-technical challenges that have not been directly addressed in existing literature or by European projects and initiatives. Based on the lessons learned from the Digital Europe for All (DE4A) large-scale pilot project, the DE4A EU-wide OOP Semantic Elicitation Framework (DEOSEF) is proposed to guide business and semantic experts in the elicitation of EU-wide evidence for target public services, through a collaborative, context-aware, and iterative agile process involving diverse communities of practice. This paper presents DEOSEF as a foundational step for future initiatives involving a combined semantic elicitation-creation of EU-wide evidence. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","2025","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","4","6","","Digit.

A step-by-step framework for optimal digitisation is proposed, grounded in archival best practice and enriched with artificial-intelligence and semantic-web technologies. Emphasis is placed on semantic data representation, which renders information actionable, searchable, interlinked, and automatically processed. As a proof of concept, a large language model—OpenAI ChatGPT, version o3—was applied to a corpus of narrative police reports, extracting and classifying key entities (metadata, persons, addresses, vehicles, incidents, fingerprints, and inter-entity relationships). The output was converted to Resource Description Framework triples and ingested into a triplestore, demonstrating how unstructured text can be transformed into machine-readable, interoperable data with minimal human intervention. The approach’s challenges—technical complexity, data quality assurance, information-security requirements, and staff training—are analysed alongside the opportunities it affords, such as accelerated access to records, cross-agency interoperability, and advanced analytics for investigative and strategic decision-making. Combining systematic digitisation, AI-driven data extraction, and rigorous semantic modelling ultimately delivers a fully interoperable information environment for law-enforcement agencies, enhancing efficiency, transparency, and evidentiary integrity. © 2025 by the authors.","2025","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","9","14","","Comput.","","","","","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; Semantic Web; Ontology; interoperability; Public administration; Digitisation; Metadata; Information use; Law enforcement; Advanced Analytics; archive digitization; Archive digitization; artificial intelligence; Data mining; Decision making; digital transformation; Digital transformation; Enforcement authorities; knowledge representation; Knowledge representation; Knowledge-representation; law-enforcement authorities; Law-enforcement authority; ontologies; Ontology's; Personnel training; Quality assurance; Security of data; Semantic systems; semantic web; Semantic-Web; SPARQL queries; SPARQL query; LR_Query: Scopus_02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this, innovative strategies like Next-Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) are being explored, integrating historical animal data with new mechanistic insights from non-animal New Approach Methodologies (NAMs). This paper introduces the TOXIN knowledge graph (TOXIN KG), a tool designed to retrieve toxicological information on cosmetic ingredients, with a focus on liver-related data. TOXIN KG uses graph-structured semantic technology and integrates toxicological data through ontologies, ensuring interoperable representation. The primary data source is safety information on cosmetic ingredients from scientific opinions issued by the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety between 2009 and 2019. The ToxRTool automates the reliability assessment of toxicity studies, while the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation standardizes chemical identification, enabling in silico prediction of repeated-dose toxicity via the implementation of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Toolbox (OECD QSAR Toolbox). The ToXic Process Ontology, enriched with relevant biological repositories, is employed to represent toxicological concepts systematically. Search filters allow the identification of cosmetic compounds potentially linked to liver toxicity. Data visualization is achieved through Ontodia, a JavaScript library. TOXIN KG, filled with information for 88 cosmetic ingredients, allowed us to identify 53 compounds affecting at least one liver toxicity parameter in a 90-day repeated-dose animal study. For one compound, we illustrate how TOXIN KG links this observation to hepatic cholestasis as an adverse outcome. In an ab initio NGRA context, follow-up in vitro studies using human-based NAMs would be necessary to understand the compound's biological activity and the molecular mechanism leading to the adverse effect. In summary, TOXIN KG emerges as a valuable tool for advancing the reusability of cosmetics safety data, providing knowledge in support of NAM-based hazard and risk assessments.

This research presents a scalable, FAIR-compliant (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data integration and governance framework for business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) contexts, addressing both metadata and data interoperability. The solution combines ETL pipelines, Semantic Web technologies, and Large Language Models (LLMs). Metadata interoperability is achieved via RDF schemas, SKOS vocabularies, and linked data principles; data-level integration is supported through schema mapping, format conversion, and LLM-assisted transformation. A dynamic ETL process uses semantic schema mapping and LLM-driven vocabulary suggestions to reduce manual alignment with domain ontologies. The framework is validated through a formal evaluation strategy combining real-world B2B and B2G case studies with comparative analysis against existing solutions. The system's applicability spans across critical B2B and B2G scenarios in domains such as finance, healthcare, public administration and logistics, illustrating its capacity to enable trustworthy data sharing and governance across institutional and organizational boundaries. © 2025 Elsevier B.V..

In countries like Vietnam, where land-related procedures are governed by a comprehensive legal framework, practical challenges persist due to uncoordinated records and complex administrative processes. To support the country’s ongoing digital transformation and legal modernization efforts, this paper introduces ViLUR, a system that integrates blockchain and semantic technologies to manage LUR in compliance with Vietnam’s 2024 Land Law and related regulations. ViLUR combines blockchain technology for secure, immutable record-keeping with the Land Use Rights Ontology (LUROn), which formally models ownership structures, legal entities, and regulatory constraints. Using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, the system automates legal compliance checks for key procedures including ownership issuance, change registration, and land recovery. Deployed on the Hyperledger Fabric framework, ViLUR is experimentally evaluated in terms of throughput, latency, and reasoning time. Results show promising improvements in transaction speed, transparency, and legal consistency. The system demonstrates practical potential for modernizing land administration and aligns closely with Vietnam’s national goals for e-government and digital transformation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2025.","2025","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","Artif Intell Law","","","","","","Springer Nature","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Ontology; Semantics; Blockchain; Legal compliance; LUR in Vietnam; SWRL rule; LR_Query: Scopus_02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This results in potential data management issues, such as redundancy and write errors. While efforts to standardize data exchange date back to the 90 s, with formats like STEP and IFC, the challenge of interoperability remains. It’s important therefore to set up integrated management systems and interoperable cloud-based technologies. The rise of open semantic standards by W3C and other organizations in recent decades has been significant, but a cohesive connection between different ontologies is necessary for the realization of Digital Twin technology, which represents the life cycle of a building, not just the design phase. After a brief introduction to Linked Data and its applications in the building industry, this work focuses on developing a data management methodology for the use and management of existing real estate assets by public administrations, with emphasis on integrating BIM models with existing asset databases using semantic web technologies like RDF, OWL, and SPARQL.

Recent work on Digital Twins for Administrative Law (DTAL)[1] suggests that legislation be issued together with machine-readable ontologies and executable logic, yet guidance on how to architect such systems remains scarce. In this work we propose a layered reference architecture that separates (i) the natural-language statute, (ii) a core ontology expressed in OWL, (iii) a configuration layer for mutable policy parameters, and (iv) an executable-rule layer exposed through a RESTful and MCP façade. Grounded in design science research, we implemented a proof-of-concept twin of the Upper-Austrian tourism-levy statute and qualitatively evaluate the twin with legal, software, and public-administration experts. Early results[2] suggest that ontology-driven twins can reduce duplicate implementations, streamline updates, and enhance legal certainty, thereby strengthening the Rule of Law in automated decision-making. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","2025","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","4064","","","","","","","","CEUR-WS","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Interoperability; Ontology; Semantics; Natural languages; Public administration; Digital twin; Decision making; Ontology's; Administrative law; Architecture; Automated decision making; Automated Decision-Making; Automation; Digital integrated circuits; Digital Twins; Executables; Forcings; Intelligent systems; Legal Ontologies; Legal ontology; Maintenance cost; Scalable architectures; Semantic interoperability; Semantic Interoperability; LR_Query: Scopus_02","","Chaves-Fraga, D.; Heibi, I.; Garijo, D.; Collarana, D.; Salatino, A.; Vahdati, S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Integrating knowledge-based artifacts into Decision Support Systems, such as Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence (DW/BI) systems, can provide new information sources, enable new analytical capabilities, and enhance decision-making. In previous work, the Balanced Scorecard Ontology (BSO) was developed to represent knowledge related to the Balanced Scorecard framework, including its concepts and relationships. The BSO was used to assess strategy formulation, implementation, and execution in a public sector organization, demonstrating its impact on strategy management. However, manual ontology population, especially related to performance indicator values, can lead to challenges in data availability, acquisition frequency, and quality. This paper proposes a semantic approach to integrating, aligning, and ensuring traceability between strategy and DW/BI systems. The Light Data Warehouse Ontology is introduced to represent the DW conceptual and logical models and semantically connect them with strategic information using the BSO. This integration enriches strategy analysis by providing strategic context to the BI environment and enabling automatic retrieval of performance indicator values. The proposed framework improves decision-making efficiency, reliability, and timeliness, providing managers with a data-driven environment aligned with organizational strategy. © 2013 IEEE.","2025","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","163103-163119","","","13","","IEEE Access","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Semantic Web; Ontology; Information use; Decision making; Ontology's; semantic web; Semantic-Web; Balanced scorecard; balanced scorecard ontology; Balanced scorecard ontology; Balanced scorecards; Business intelligence systems; Data quality; Data reliability; Data warehouse/business intelligence system; data warehouse/business intelligence systems; Data warehouses; Decision support systems; Decisions makings; Information retrieval; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Semantic-Web techniques; strategic management; Strategic management; Strategic planning; LR_Query: Scopus_02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ontology of war has changed. Preserving the adversarial qualities of democratic societies risks failures of ignorance, exaggeration, and misdirection. Preserving global commons remains essential for security. Design thinking offers tools to explore problems and develop creative solutions. Society itself is both an asset and a potential target for Grey Zone threats. Tools for response depend on greater awareness and investment in information, monitoring, and interagency coordination. Strategies and defensive tools must integrate traditionally separate expertise. Security education should be holistic, preparing the professionals of most countries for cross-domain employment. Military, paramilitary, police, intelligence, and public service, as inverted professions, will require early exposure to each other.

The study focuses on Sendagaya, Tokyo, an area that hosts multiple large-capacity venues. Using Random Forest regression, we evaluated our model that incorporates event and weather data and compared it with our baseline model, which uses only temporal features. Our results indicate that while temporal data alone yield stable predictions, incorporating event-specific and weather-related factors enhances the prediction accuracy of foot traffic peaks during large events.

While the automotive industry's demand for electric vehicles increases, sectors like aerospace are also exploring electric applications. However, relying on batteries as the primary power source presents challenges such as high costs, limited availability of raw materials, and safety concerns. Additionally, inconsistent battery usage leads to varying rates of battery degradation, posing further difficulties. This study aims to understand battery degradation in electric aircraft subjected to different battery charging parameters using multi-domain modeling. The long-term goal is to facilitate the commercialization of electric aircraft by making them more economically viable while considering real-world constraints. An open-source multi-domain model built in the MATLAB-Simscape environment provides a robust platform to simulate different flight profiles and track battery degradation in terms of battery capacity. To analyze battery behavior under various conditions, we examined different flight routes characterized by distinct load profiles with varying charging parameters. The analysis focuses on a battery pack composed of Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt cells with a capacity of 260~Ah at 418~V; resulting in a nominal pack capacity of 109~kWh. We evaluated the effects of battery degradation across three flight routes in the southeastern United States under two charging rates: 1.5C and 2C. Results show that charging at 1.5C degrades the battery significantly less than charging at 2C. Additionally, starting flights with an initial state of charge of 80% instead of 100% further reduced battery degradation across all flight routes. Variations in flight route length were found to have a minimum effect. By incorporating battery degradation into smarter route planning, the study offers pathways to improve the sustainability and economic viability of electric aviation. This suggests that careful selection of battery charging parameters can mitigate some of the current limitations of electric aircraft. © 2024 Lockheed Martin Corporation.

The present study aims to analyse several semantic aspects of 3 major international data portals and their metadata schemas mapped to the main DCAT schema classes in order to assess the current status regarding metadata provision and aiming towards prospective standardisation and improved semantic interoperability of the datasets available. The analysis revealed several persisting challenges, including the lack of standardised information (e.g., controlled vocabularies) as accepted values of the identified mandatory metadata fields in use, or, in the case of existing standardisation schemas, a misalignment and lack of consensus among the different portals. The study also pinpoints future research lines centred around the elicitation of guidelines and practices to standardise not only descriptive but also domain-specific metadata provision across the portals, facilitating the process towards the identification of minimum sets of metadata descriptions applicable to various contexts, and reaching one step closer to the envisioned interoperable ODPs paradigm. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","147-157","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

The LNEC - National Laboratory for Civil Engineering's strategy is used as an exploratory case study. Semantic web technologies are used to perform strategy analysis, including validating the strategy formulation and supporting the strategy execution by assessing performance indicators, verifying the design of cause-and-effect relationships between strategic objectives, and monitoring and empirically validating these relationships. The increased interoperability of these technologies enables information sharing across systems and organizations. Following the strategy analysis, recommendations are provided, leading to a more robust and data-driven strategic management approach, enabling accurate, traceable, and continuous monitoring of an organization's strategy.

These models impede sustainable developments by forming data silos that hinder cross-application data exchange and knowledge discovery processes. Although Semantic Web solutions hold promise in addressing these silos, current approaches primarily focus on developing novel ontologies, yielding similar outcomes. But it is unclear how these methodologies could support broader knowledge discovery processes and application requirements. This paper addresses these research challenges by introducing a dynamic knowledge graph as implemented within The World Avatar for interoperable building models. We demonstrate its value through two distinct applications in urban energy management and laboratory automation. The dynamic knowledge graph revolves around a comprehensive structured knowledge model constructed from ontologies and agents. Ontologies semantically annotate data and represent domain knowledge and their relationships with standardised definitions. When augmented with an agent architecture, the resulting knowledge model can align stakeholder perspectives and accommodate the dynamic and scalable nature of urban data. Moreover, the dynamic knowledge graph fosters innovative human-machine interactions through visualisation interfaces to augment knowledge discovery processes in the built environment for greater efficiencies and innovation. As the knowledge model expands, users gain access to a broader spectrum of private and public data sources and technologies, while reducing integration barriers. This is especially pertinent for smaller and less influential entities like municipal and local governments with limited resources, who can realise substantial benefits at reduced costs. © 2024","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","91","","J.

BIM creates a collaborative digital representation of built environment data. Competitive advantage can be achieved with collaborative project delivery and rich information modelling. Despite the abundant benefits, BIM’s adoption in the AEC is susceptible to confrontation. A substantial impediment to BIM adoption often cited is data interoperability. Other facets of interoperability got limited attention. Other academic areas, including information systems, discuss the interoperability construct ahead of data interoperability. These interoperability factors have yet to be surveyed in the AEC industry. This study aims to investigate the effect of interoperability factors on BIM adoption and develop a comprehensive BIM adoption model. Design/methodology/approach: The theoretical foundations of the proposed model are based on the European interoperability framework (EIF) and technology, organization, environment framework (TOE). Quantitative data collection from construction firms is gathered. The model has been thoroughly examined and validated using partial least squares structural equation modelling in SmartPLS software. Findings: The study’s findings indicate that relative advantage, top management support, government support, organizational readiness and regulation support are determinants of BIM adoption. Financial constraints, complexity, lack of technical interoperability, semantic interoperability, organizational interoperability and uncertainty are barriers to BIM adoption. However, compatibility, competitive pressure and legal interoperability do not affect BIM adoption. Practical implications: Finally, this study provides recommendations containing the essential technological, organizational, environmental and interoperability factors that AEC stakeholders can address to enhance BIM adoption. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first studies to combine TOE and EIF in a single research model. This research provides empirical evidence for using the proposed model as a guide to promoting BIM adoption. As a result, the highlighted determinants can assist organizations in developing and executing successful policies that support BIM adoption in the AEC industry. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","606-642","","2","24","","Constr.

Consequently, it is important to determine the effects of this additional load on the network so that measures can be taken to prevent threats to the system's stability, dependability, and security, especially because the Indian federal and state governments have introduced incentives to increase sales of this type of vehicle. © 2024 IEEE.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","633-637","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Within European data spaces, high priority is given to adherence to FAIR data principles. Thus, data and services should be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. Ontologies as semantic models are fundamental in achieving semantic interoperability, as they provide a common framework for data and service access, discovery, understanding and reuse. However, the inherent complexity of data space initiatives, coupled with their underlying domains diversity are key challenge facing optimal FAIRness. This motivates the need for an agile methodology that aligns with data space principles, integrates existing domain standards, consolidates the use of metadata for ontology’s FAIRness, and engages various involved actors (domain experts, data service providers, ontology engineers) towards the development of common data space ontology. In the frame of the OMEGA-X project, aiming to build an energy data space, this paper presents AIME, an ontology development methodology integrating the reuse of both standards and reference ontologies to enable the development of modular ontologies for data spaces. It leverages agile principles to strengthen communication between various stakeholders through different steps: reference standards and ontologies selection, selection of use cases, design and selection of interaction models capturing data exchanges, ontology modules creation, automation and continuous integration features to support the entire original ontology engineering phase and reuse by data space users. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","3882","","","","","","","","CEUR-WS","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Ontology; Ontology's; Data space; Data consistency; Agile developement; Development methodology; European standards; European Standards; FAIR principle; FAIR principles; Interaction modeling; Modular ontologies; Ontology development; Ontology Engineering Methodologies; Ontology engineering methodology; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","Oliveira, I.; Barcelos, P.P.F.; Calhau, R.; Fonseca, C.M.; Righetti, G.; De Giorgis, S.; Sacco, G.; Hedblom, M.M.; Kutz, O.; Glauer, M.; Stappel, M.; Trojahn, C.; Poveda-Villalon, M.; Garijo, D.; Bernabe, C.H.; Lin, A.Y.; Compagno, F.; Fensel, A.; Terkaj, W.; Adamo, G.; Dooley, D.; Kumpel, M.; Bordea, G.; Warren, R.; Sehar, A.; Lange, M.; Bindt, F.; Toxopeus, I.; Audrito, D.; Grasso, F.; Nai, R.; Sulis, E.; Beverley, J.; Jensen, M.; de Cesare, S.; Gailly, F.; Guizzardi, G.; Partridge, C.; Partridge, C.; Pastor, O.; Castro, A.G.; Hubauer, T.; Suess, W.; Schmurr, P.; Willis, M.; Santamaria, D.F.; van Ede, T.; Klein, D.; Engelberg, G.; Engelberg, G.; Castiglione, G.; Bella, G.; Continella, A.; Lanti, D.; Mosca, A.; Scafoglieri, F.M.; Xiao, G.; Kutt, K.; Fernandez-Breis, J.T.; Pichler, A.; Palko, G.; Nalepa, G.J.; Garbacz, P.; Pergl, R.; Khan, Z.C.; Barcelos, P.P.F.; Moreira, J.; Barton, A.; Sanfilippo, E.M.; Daniele, L.; Almeida, J.P.A.; Franconi, E.; Johannesson, P.; Ghidini, C.; Zamborlini, V.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Governments are typically in charge of publishing these datasets, but they typically employ disparate data formats (sometimes proprietary ones) and published datasets are commonly disconnected from other sources, including previous versions of such datasets. As a result, the usage of forestry data is very challenging, especially if we need to combine multiple datasets. Methods and results: Semantic Web technologies, standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), have emerged in the last decades as a solution to publish heterogeneous data in an interoperable way. They enable the publication of self-describing data that can easily interlink with other sources. The concepts and relationships between them are described using ontologies, and the data can be published as Linked Data on the Web, which can be downloaded or queried online. National and international agencies promote the publication of governmental data as Linked Open Data, and research fields such as biosciences or cultural heritage make an extensive use of Semantic Web technologies. In this study, we present the result of the European Cross-Forest project, addressing the integration and publication of national forest inventories and land cover maps from Spain and Portugal using Semantic Web technologies. We used a bottom-up methodology to design the ontologies, with the goal of being generalizable to other countries and forestry datasets. First, we created an ontology for each dataset to describe the concepts (plots, trees, positions, measures, and so on) and relationships between the data in detail. We converted the source data into Linked Open Data by using the ontology to annotate the data such as species taxonomies. As a result, all the datasets are integrated into one place this is the Cross-Forest dataset and are available for querying and analysis through a SPARQL endpoint. These data have been used in real-world use cases such as (1) providing a graphical representation of all the data, (2) combining it with spatial planning data to reveal the forestry resources under the management of Spanish municipalities, and (3) facilitating data selection and ingestion to predict the evolution of forest inventories and simulate how different actions and conditions impact this evolution. Discussion: The work started in the Cross-Forest project continues in current lines of research, including the addition of the temporal dimension to the data, aligning the ontologies and data with additional well-known vocabularies and datasets, and incorporating additional forestry resources. © © 2024 Giménez-García, Vega-Gorgojo, Ordóñez, Crespo-Lera and Bravo.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","7","","Front.

Born in the context of the ISA2 European programme for the development of digital solutions for interoperable cross-border and cross-sector public services, ShowVoc aims at providing a one-stop shop for maximizing the diffusion of semantic and lexical resources as Linked Open Data. To this end, ShowVoc combines traditional data provisioning following LOD policies with global activities (e.g. global search, navigation of dataset relationships/alignments, translation API benefiting from multilingual datasets and linksets). A rich dataset browsing interface provides dedicated support for diverse data models: OWL ontologies, SKOS/SKOS-XL thesauri, OntoLex-Lemon lexicons and generic RDF datasets and linkage possibilities (EDOAL, XKOS). A metadata registry completes the offer combining different metadata vocabularies into an advanced catalog that can be inspected through a convenient user interface and LOD best practices.

The whole semantic system of this study includes SV, SC, DOC, ISV, and SG. The Semantic Validation technique performs parametric validation, scoring, and threshold comparison to safeguard data integrity, whereas the Semantic Agreement algorithm combines meanings by adding agreement values. Decentralized ontologies are improved using Distributed Ontology Construction to accommodate new meaning linkages. connected Semantic Verification detects semantic meaning compatibility across linked networks. Lastly, meaning Governance enables individuals to decide on recommended meaning modifications without centralization. Comparative analysis examines the framework. Tables and illustrations indicate its dominance over key aspects. The recommended strategy generally outperforms Web3 evolution methods in security, scale, interoperability, user privacy, and government effectiveness. Visualizing the process with pie charts, layered analysis, and temporal trends shows its efficacy. This semantic framework's consistency, correctness, and flexibility are key responses to Web3's changes. The framework's continual refinement methods can shape Web3 Internet semantics as open networks change. This semantic framework helps establish a decentralized and connected Internet as bitcoin and Web3 technologies progress.

Among the intellectual property (IP) assets, the patents have a strategic role because they contain from 70 to 90% of information about technologies. One of the most prominent phases in managing patents is their classification according to a proposed taxonomy, a particularly expensive and time-consuming phase, above all due to the increase in the number of filed patents, the complexity of the contents and the difficulty in classify them in the right category. Users that search for a potentially useful patent, often deal with “monster class”, multidisciplinary categories containing a significant number of poorly characterized and classified patents. Monster categories are thus ineffective, not discriminating, and difficult to explore. A typical example of “monster class” is often present in the healthcare related patents, due to its multidisciplinary and particularly innovative nature. The paper proposes an approach for: i) improving taxonomy-based classification by using Natural Language Processing and clustering techniques; ii) improving keywords-based classifications by using a complex network analysis on the most frequent words. The approach was experimented on Knowledge-Share platform (an Italian patent platform) with a particular attention on patent related to healthcare 4.0 with the aim of identifying the technology trends in this cross-domain context, where artificial intelligence is identified to be having an impact, such as in robotic assisted surgery, personalized medicine, drug discovery, imaging & diagnostic, diseases monitoring, assisted living, automated clinical decision support, elderly care, and so on. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","131-143","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Most notably they are both used for observation, such as the case of climate monitoring or surveying and mapping. Satellites also have uses in communication and navigation by broadcasting signals and enabling technology such as global positioning systems (GPS). UAVs have also been deployed by the militaries across the world for both reconnaissance and offensive capabilities.

With recent efforts, a need for improved interoperability, translation, and sustainability of Federal nanoEHS data in the United States has been realized. The NaKnowBase (NKB) is a relational database containing experimental results generated by the EPA Office of Research and Development (ORD) regarding the actions of engineered nanomaterials on environmental and biological systems. Through the interaction of the National Nanotechnology Initiative’s Nanotechnology Environmental Health Implications (NEHI) Working Group, and the Database and Informatics Interest Group (DIIG), a U.S. Federal nanoEHS Consortium has been formed. Methods: The primary goal of this consortium is to establish a “common language” for nanoEHS data that aligns with FAIR data standards. A second goal is to overcome nomenclature issues inherent to nanomaterials data, ultimately allowing data sharing and interoperability across the diverse U.S. Federal nanoEHS data compendium, but also in keeping a level of consistency that will allow interoperability with U.S. and European partners. The most recent version of the EPA NaKnowBase (NKB) has been implemented for semantic integration. Computational code has been developed to use each NKB record as input, modify and filter table data, and subsequently output each modified record to a Research Description Framework (RDF). To improve the accuracy and efficiency of this process the EPA has created the OntoSearcher tool. This tool partially automates the ontology mapping process, thereby reducing onerous manual curation. Conclusions: Here we describe the efforts of the US EPA in promoting FAIR data standards for Federal nanoEHS data through semantic integration, as well as in the development of NAMs (computational tools) to facilitate these improvements for nanoEHS data at the Federal partner level. ©: © 2024 Mortensen HM et al.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","13","","F1000 Res.","","","","","","F1000 Research Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","human; Humans; ontology; Article; computer aided design; conceptual framework; database; Databases, Factual; drug industry; environmental health; Environmental Health; factual database; government; knowledge; nanomaterial; Nanostructures; nanotechnology; Nanotechnology; peer review; public health; training; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From a circular economy compliance monitoring perspective, beyond the access to mandatory data that governments will receive, authorities may benefit from accessing additional business data from the source on a voluntary basis, which is challenging. While platforms and data spaces solve a great deal of complexity and interoperability within their realm, platform, and data space interoperability is still challenging. In the logistics domain, efforts have been made to overcome these issues of data sharing across logistics platforms with a Semantic data sharing architecture developed by the CEF FEDeRATED Action, at the heart of which is a semantic model aligning other semantic models for logistics. In this paper, we take the Semantic data sharing architecture as a point of departure and examine the opportunities and limitations that it has for CE monitoring, and how it relates to other developments in the EU and beyond. Many of these developments acknowledge the need for data access across heterogeneous systems and – processes of actors; others add security and trust to data sharing that goes all the way to the level to cover legal obligations. The goal of this paper is to gain further insights into how data sharing across multiple platforms and data spaces enables circular economy monitoring, where government organizations would need to address the issue of how they would interface with, and access data that resides in multiple platforms and data spaces. We found that the various models can be aligned on some architecture principles that promote interoperability across dimensions (e.g. federation, keeping data at the source), yet they still differ on other dimensions (e.g. data model and semantics, as well as how they address issues of identification, authentication and authorization). We suggest further efforts towards developing meta-level agreements and standardization for data space interoperability and we propose further research directions on that topic. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","2024","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","332-351","","","921 LNNS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

This study explored the semantic web and ontology used to enhance e-government services. It found that improving ontology for searched and information retrieval processes could help computers retrieve accurate results, improve interoperability and integration, and provide a knowledge base for terms used in building databases and applications. However, more research is needed to effectively integrate ontology into existing systems and extend these approaches to real-world contexts.

The semantic interoperability of Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) requires rich and well-defined metadata, as well as the establishment of standards, in order to be able to connect and link these scattered legal data resources. This is usually achieved through the transformation of legal information into structured format and through the utilization of legal ontologies whose main purpose is to connect the legal basis of two or more countries by allowing for reusability and the ability to adequately represent legal information, which is understood and retrieved across borders. Within the context of this study, the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and Akoma Ntoso (AKN) ontologies are mapped in order to make legal data compatible and reusable in as many contexts as possible and to support the Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) concept. The mapping of these two widely used legal ontologies was evaluated by domain experts and strongly validated by tools. The usefulness of the produced mapping is proven through its real-life context application, although one thing to consider regarding possible future perspectives, could be the inclusion and mapping of more legal ontologies to expand the application domain and improve the semantic interoperability of legal information. These mappings could be either achieved using similar methodological approaches or applications of automated and AI-based ontology mapping techniques. © 2023 Owner/Author.","2023","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","41-53","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

Yet, most research and policy efforts aimed at understanding the implications of adopting AI tend to prioritize only a handful of ideas; they do not fully connect all the different perspectives and topics that are potentially relevant. In this position paper, we contend that this omission stems, in part, from what we call the 'relational problem' in socio-technical discourse: fundamental ontological issues have not yet been settled - including semantic ambiguity, a lack of clear relations between concepts and differing standard terminologies. This contributes to the persistence of disparate modes of reasoning to assess institutional AI systems, and the prevalence of conceptual isolation in the fields that study them including ML, human factors, social science and policy. After developing this critique, we offer a way forward by proposing a simple policy and research design tool in the form of a conceptual framework to organize terms across fields - consisting of three horizontal domains for grouping relevant concepts and related methods: Operational, Epistemic, and Normative. We first situate this framework against the backdrop of recent socio-technical discourse at two premier academic venues, AIES and FAccT, before illustrating how developing suitable metrics, standards, and mechanisms can be aided by operationalizing relevant concepts in each of these domains. Finally, we outline outstanding questions for developing this relational approach to institutional AI research and adoption. © 2023 ACM.","2023","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","512-519","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIES - Proc.

We propose a solution using Semantic and Structural Mapping techniques within CAREPATH; a research project designed to develop ICT solutions for the care management of elderly multimorbid patients with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Our technical interoperability solution supplies a standard-based data exchange protocol to enable information exchange between local care systems and CAREPATH components.

While this data influx offers unparalleled insights and connectivity, it also brings significant privacy and security challenges. Existing regulatory frameworks like the United States (US) National Institute of Standards and Technology Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8228, the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aim to address these challenges but often operate in isolation, making their compliance in the vast IoT ecosystem inconsistent. This paper presents the IoT-Reg ontology, a holistic semantic framework that amalgamates these regulations, offering a stratified approach based on the IoT data lifecycle stages and providing a comprehensive yet granular approach to IoT data handling practices. The IoT-Reg ontology aims to transform the IoT domain into a realm where regulatory controls are seamlessly integrated system components by emphasizing risk management, compliance, and the pivotal role of manufacturers' privacy policies, ensuring consistent adherence, enhancing user trust, and promoting a privacy-centric IoT environment.

However, pieces of information without a context are significantly less valuable. Raw data lacks semantics and it is highly heterogeneous from one data-source to another. This poses a challenge to make it useful. To turn all this data into valuable information it is necessary to enable its combination so that meaningful context can be created. Moreover, it is fundamental to define the mechanisms enabling the adoption and orchestration of advanced (typically AI-enabled) data processing techniques to be applied over the harmonized datasets and data-streams. This paper presents the Data Enrichment Toolchain (DET) that provides the necessary harmonization and enrichment to datasets and data-streams coming from heterogeneous sources. The value of the enriched data lies on the one hand in the transfer of the data into a semantically grounded knowledge graph and, on the other hand, in the creation of new data through linking, aggregating and reasoning on the data. In both cases, the benefit of employing linked-data modelling and semantics comes from the extension of the metadata that is associated to every piece of information.

This paper presents a modified algorithm for dynamic data transformation based on blockchain technology for Master Data Management Systems (MDM), incorporating Ethereum, IPFS and semantic data. Based on the proposed algorithm, an architectural approach is also described that allows developing semantic data management systems. The algorithm assumes data validation, enrichment, and deduplication processes, while also ensuring consistency and trust among multiple participants through the decentralized nature of the blockchain. The semantic data management aspect of the system is achieved using Apache Jena and local ontology, which facilitate semantic interoperability and efficient data processing. The proposed approach addresses the challenge of applying blockchain technology to semantic MDM systems and demonstrates an approach to using the system in Semantic Web, as well as in areas such as finance, healthcare, public administration, and logistics. We evaluated the algorithm using a customer information dataset from an e-commerce platform. The results confirmed the potential of blockchain technology in data management and showed improvements in data accuracy, consistency, completeness, but with some loss in storage efficiency due to the use of blockchain. This paper contributes to developing and evaluating a novel algorithm and architecture, combining blockchain technology, MDM principles, and semantic data management for improving data quality, security, and performance in decentralized systems. However, further research and assessment may be required for the full implementation and evaluation of the system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2023","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","555-571","","","14104 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Designing a suitable architectural framework is required to ensure the efficiency and sustainability of the implementation of such systems. Consolidating public services about citizens’ safety and authorisation decisions when a resource is accessed in an open-dynamic environment are the main challenges that can be highlighted. Therefore, the semantic heterogeneity between the local policies of the different domains is a crucial lock for implementing this process. Our approach goes beyond the semantic web languages’ weaknesses by combining the XACML-based security policy model with a semantic rules language developed during the European SembySem Project. Built on top of RDF(S), the proposed model aims to abstract the security implementation, reconcile semantic differences across multi-domain, and maintain the local security policy. Moreover, this model addresses the semantic heterogeneity of sensors’ data during knowledge-sharing. © © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","2023","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:08:39","","1-17","","1","43","","Int.

Part of PS provision is publishing PS descriptions in online catalogues to inform citizens and promote transparency. The European Union has developed the Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP) as a PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and promote semantic interoperability. The use of CPSV-AP is increasing within the European Union leading to a number of relevant PS descriptions that are also potentially beneficial for the implementation of the Single Digital Gateway (SDG) regulation. However, the use of heterogeneous, some times not very popular technologies (e.g. RDF) to provide access to such data hinders their further uniform exploitation. Towards this problem definition, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can provide a uniform, easily-consumable way of serving such data hiding any heterogeneity of the underlying technologies. The aim of this paper is to design and implement an API to serve data based on CPSV-AP facilitating the implementation of the SDG and the further exploitation of data at added value services and tools e.g. chatbots. The paper describes the requirements, use cases, design choices and implementation details of the API. We anticipate that the proposed API will help towards the further adoption of CPSV-AP by facilitating and homogenizing the consumption of relevant data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2023","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","291-304","","","464 LNBIP","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The potential benefits of open government data are numerous and include increasing transparency and accountability, enhancing citizens' quality of life, and boosting innovation. However, realizing these benefits is not always straightforward, as the usage of this raw data often faces challenges related to its format, structure, and heterogeneity which hinder its processability and integration. In response to these challenges, we propose an approach to maximize the usage of open government data and achieve its potential benefits. This approach leverages knowledge graphs to extract value from open government data and drive the construction of a knowledge graph from structured, semi-structured, and non-structured formats. It involves the extraction, transformation, semantic enrichment, and integration of heterogeneous open government data sources into an integrated and semantically enhanced knowledge graph. Learning mechanisms and ontologies are used to efficiently construct the knowledge graph.

The European Commission has developed Core Public Service Vocabulary Application Profile (CPSV-AP), as a standard European PS data model to facilitate PS catalogue creation and semantic interoperability. However, CPSV-AP is not sufficient to model complex PS with different versions based on rules and citizens’ circumstances (e.g., getting a passport for a child or for an emergency). As a result, citizens cannot obtain personalized information on PS. The aim of this paper is to enhance CPSV-AP in order to support the modeling of complex PS. We illustrate the use of the proposed model in a real-life case study. Specifically, we use the proposed model to develop a knowledge graph and a chatbot that provides personalized information to citizens of the city of Bjelovar (Croatia) regarding the life-event “having a baby”.

Complexity, cross-cutting nature, diversity of data sets, interoperability and quality issues usually hamper unlocking the full potential value of data. To tackle these challenges, this paper aims to provide a novel solution using a top-down approach. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors propose a systematic ontology-based approach combined with a novel architecture and its corresponding processes enabling organizations to carry out all the steps in the OGD value chain. In addition, an OGD Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) are developed to showcase the proposed solution. Findings: The efficiency and the applicability of the solution are evaluated by a real-life use case on energy consumption of the buildings of the city of Tehran, Iran. Finally, a comparison was made with existing solutions, and the results show the proposed approach is able to address the existing gaps in the literature. Originality/value: The results imply that modeling and designing the data model, as well as exploiting an ontology-based approach are critical pillars to create rich, relevant and well-described OGD data sets. Moreover, clarity on processes, roles and responsibilities are the key factors influencing the quality of the published data services. Thus, to the best of the knowledge, this is the first study that exploits and considers an ontology-based approach in a top-down manner to create OGD data sets. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","110-127","","1","16","","Trans.

Sources of data relating to land use in the UK have been surveyed. The Crop Map of England (CROME) is produced annually by the UK Government and was identified as a valuable source of open data. Formal ontologies to represent land use and the geospatial data arising from such surveys have been developed. The ontologies have been deployed using a high-performance graph database. A customized vocabulary was developed to extend the geospatial capabilities of the graph database to support the CROME data. The integration of the CROME data into the Universal Digital Twin is demonstrated in two use cases that show the potential of the Universal Digital Twin to share data across sectors. The first use case combines data about land use with a geospatial analysis of scenarios for energy provision. The second illustrates how the Universal Digital Twin could use the land use data to support the cross-domain analysis of flood risk. Opportunities for the extension and enrichment of the ontologies, and further development of the Universal Digital Twin are discussed. © The Author(s), 2022.

Based on the Bologna process and the European higher education area, learning mobility has been successful under Erasmus and other similar initiatives. However, a key issue for students and universities is that a significant amount of time is spent on the manual labour involved in the process of applying to degree programs overseas. It is therefore essential for higher education institutions to better exploit the potential of technology and Web 2.0 to enable a secure exchange of evidence during application for degree programs and academic courses in foreign Higher Education Institutions, as well as applying for study grants and obtaining recognition for academic and other types of studies. Harmonisation of the student data is a key initial step for enabling such exchange. In this study, an approach to a secured exchange of education evidence is instrumented under the H2020 project Digital Europe for All (DE4A). Existing semantic standards for Web 2.0 applications, core vocabularies for public service data and semantic assets from existing best practices such as W3C, ISA2 core vocabularies, and Europass data model are used to curate data models that allow the exchange of a higher education diploma, secondary education diploma and information of special needs (disability, large family), which is required by students when requesting study grants (waive of tuition fees). The semantic interoperability agreements are established cross-border through these data models called canonical evidences. The canonical evidences are tested with the national data services of three countries, Portugal, Slovenia, and Spain. The final data models are implemented in XML Schema format that could be used by any educational organisation intending to use trusted public service databases within Europe to automatically retrieve information on students’ degrees. The validity of the canonical evidences is tested on two pilot occasions within the DE4A project. The outcome of this study summarises the procedural requirements for evidences when applying for a higher degree program and seeking grants.

Government Institutions have developed various applications providing public or inter-governmental services. These E-Government applications, some are legacy applications, were built independently using different platforms. Consequently, this heterogeneity creates problems such as lack of data integration and system interoperability. This integration/interoperability problem makes it difficult to perform semantic linking between databases to create a government knowledge base which is critical for knowledge discovery and innovation. Ontology has been regarded as a promising technology to solve this integration/interoperability problem as it provides semantic interoperability and promotes knowledge discovery and innovation. To support the development and operation of cross domain government ontology services for semantic interoperability in e-government systems, it is necessary to define an ecosystem model. The aim of research is to design an ontology development ecosystem model for Indonesian E-Government System using Ecosystem Pie Model. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","99-103","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proceeding - Int.

It therefore becomes crucial to rigorously assess the information workflows associated with built assets in order to help deliver the subsequent assessment services and certification schemes. The Smart Readiness Indicator is a new assessment scheme directed at harmonizing the smartness levels of buildings and intelligent installations at a European level. While the European Union defines the Smart Readiness Indicator scope and assessment methodology towards new regulations with the member states, the availability of data should strategically rely on existing sources such as the Building Information Model in order to automate and simplify the efforts of assessors. This paper explores the potential of Building Information Model data, more specifically relying on the Industry Foundation Classes schema, to support assessors with more automatic extraction of relevant information on the building and its equipment. The adopted methodology looks at the semantic alignment between the two domains. An initial alignment of concepts from several versions of the Industry Foundation Classes is proposed. This alignment was implemented using several rules, which were tested on the architectural and mechanical models of the same building. The study shows the convenience of employing such a methodology, the usefulness of data from existing building models, but also their limitations in correctly identifying relevant concepts. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

However, e-government systems along with heterogeneous databases have created difficulties in interoperability. These heterogeneous databases lead to data redundancy, data inconsistency, and difficulty to integrate data and process data among agencies. The representation of heterogeneous systems through common standards and vocabularies is considered a valuable solution for interoperability. In this paper, an ontology-based framework for Bhutan's e-government is proposed to support semantic interoperability. To evaluate the framework, the domain ontology for Bhutan's Administrative Division, namely BTNAD is developed and discussed. BTNAD Ontology has been implemented and verified using Protégé, and its practical usage has been validated by checking against the defined competency questions and the corresponding SP ARQL query implementation. The presented study can clearly demonstrate the Single Source of Truth (SSOT), hence enabling the data reusability and collaboration, and interoperability within and across the agencies. Finally, the research discusses some recommendations from the proposed framework and interoperability challenges. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Internet of Things (IoT) services are developed to increase energy efficiency in buildings. The W3C recommends the use of the W3C Web of Things (WoT) standard to enable IoT interoperability on the Web. However, the ability to discover IoT devices available in the WoT remains a challenge due to the lack of ontologies integrating WoT Thing Descriptions in smart buildings. We present in this paper the domOS Common Ontology (dCO) to achieve the W3C WoT discovery in smart residential buildings in 5 demonstration sites of the H2020 EU domOS project. This ontology integrates the WoT Thing Description with IoT concepts, i.e. IoT devices and building topology, in order to leverage the W3C WoT Discovery.

These databases often run in heterogeneous hardware and software environments and use different, project-specific data models. These conditions lead to a high degree of autonomy but to an increasing heterogeneity. The heterogeneity then leads to the problem that these databases cannot be easily merged into a federated database system (FDBS). In general, a FDBS integrates multiple autonomous database systems into a single FDBS. The challenge is now to merge multiple heterogeneous systems into one FDBS to provide successful federated searches. Here, the term successful means that the results of a search query are correctly and completely answered by all integrated domain-specific database systems. In addition to delivering correct and complete results from these queries, semantically and syntactically correct mappings of various database schemes must be ensured. We argue that at the faculty of the Humanities, a cross-domain use of autonomously developed databases offers added value in terms of data analysis and evaluation. Hence, the challenge that exists is to develop a suitable federated database infrastructure that supports the development of autonomous information systems, while heterogeneity does not increase. To meet this challenge, in IT projects in the defense sector and in the public administration of the federal government, the V-model is a mandatory procedural standard to develop IT systems systematically. When developing a cross-domain information system, special attention should be paid to the development of variants, i.e. the project-specific information systems, so that the extension of the federated infrastructure at the faculty is guaranteed and can be maintained in the long term. In the area of Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) variant modeling is a very current topic and no standard exists. However, there are some approaches that can be used, such as the method Variant Modeling with SysML (VAMOS). VAMOS is characterized by its ease of use to model variants and can be combined very well with other methods. In this paper we present a model-based approach to develop a federated database infrastructure for supporting the usability of a cross-domain information system. For the development of a federated database infrastructure we present how the V-model can be combined with the VAMOS method using the tool Cameo Systems Modeler for modeling and simulating in general, the broker-based SysML Toolbox for simulating database interactions, and the database management system Heurist for creating a cross-domain information system. © 2022 IEEE.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: SysCon - Annu.

Although ontologies have been used in numerous industrial projects, the problem of semantic interoperability in the industry is still unresolved. One reason for the lack of success of ontologies in the industry is that most industrial ontologies have been developed based on local needs without taking wider applications into account or attempting to learn from earlier ontology initiatives or reuse the existing ontologies. In this position paper, we argue that for widespread adoption and implementation of ontologies, more systematic and coordinated efforts are needed with the participation of industry, academia, and government at an international level. We also hypothesise that a coordinated and systematic ontology development effort will incrementally lead to the creation of an ecosystem of interoperable software applications that support consistent data access and reasoning across the product life cycle. We discuss why efforts such as Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) can promote a methodological ontology development process by introducing modular, and reusable ontologies. We draw examples from two domain areas, namely supply chain management and production planning and scheduling, to demonstrate how industrial notions can be analysed ontologically according to IOF procedures and methods. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","2022","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","420-441","","2","60","","Int J Prod Res","","","","","","Taylor and Francis Ltd.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; Ontology; Semantics; interoperability; Planning; Ontology's; Life cycle; Semantic interoperability; Ontology development; Position papers; Application programs; Digital manufacturing; Industrial programs; Learn+; Manufacture; Production control; production planning and scheduling; Production planning and scheduling; Reuse; Scheduling; supply chain management; Supply chain management; ZDM; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The interdisciplinary Research Centre HiMAT (History of mining activities in the Tyrol and adjacent areas, University of Innsbruck) investigates mining history from prehistoric to modern times with an interdisciplinary approach. One of the projects carried out at the research centre is the multinational DACH project “Prehistoric copper production in the eastern and central Alps”. For a specific geographical region of the project, the data transformation to open and re-usable data is investigated in a separate Open Research Data pilot project. The methodological approach will use the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Re-usable. Every archaeological investigation in Austria has to be documented according to the requirements of the Austrian Federal Monuments Office. This documentation is deposited in the CERN-based EU supported research data repository ZENODO. For each deposited file, metadata are created through the application of the conceptual metadata schema CIDOC CRM, an ISO standard for Cultural Heritage Information, which was adopted by ARIADNE, the European Union Research Infrastructure for archaeological resources. Concepts specific to mining archaeology research are organized with the DARIAH Back Bone Thesaurus, a model for sustainable interoperable thesauri maintenance, developed in the European Union Digital Research Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. Metadata are created through the extraction of information from the documentation and the transformation to a knowledge graph using semantic web standards. To facilitate usage, graph data are exported to hierarchical and tabular formats representing sites and objects with their geographic locations, temporal and typological assignments and links to the research activities and documents.

These applications store useful data for decision-making. However, data items often remain spread in different applications, each of which adopt different data and behavioral models, posing a barrier for integrated data usage. As a consequence, data-driven decisions in agile development are uncommon, missing valuable opportunities for informed decision making. Objective: Considering the need to address semantic issues to properly integrate applications that support the agile development process, we aim to provide a common and comprehensive conceptualization about Scrum in the software development context and apply this conceptualization to support application integration. Method: We have developed the Scrum Reference Ontology (SRO) and used it to semantically integrate Azure DevOps and Clockify. Results: SRO served as a reference model to build software artifacts in a semantic integration architecture that enables applications to automatically share, exchange and combine data and services. The integrated solution was used in the software development unit of a Brazilian government agency. Results demonstrate that the integrated solution contributed to improving estimates, provided data that helped allocate teams, manage team productivity and project performance, and enabled to identify and fix problems in the Scrum process execution. Conclusions: SRO can serve as an interlingua for application integration in the context of Scrum-process support. By capturing the conceptualization underlying Scrum, the reference ontology can address semantic conflicts and thereby support the development of integrated data-driven solutions for decision making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","136","","Inf Software Technol","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Ontology; Semantics; Integration; Reference modeling; Decision making; Data integration; Semantic Interoperability; Application programs; Application integration; Application Integration; Data driven decision; Government agencies; Integrated solutions; Project management; Project management tools; Scrum; Semantic integration; Software design; Team productivities; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BIM provides the capabilities of cost reduction, increase quality, enhanced productivity, and on-time delivery. Despite the numerous advantages of BIM, its adoption in AEC is vulnerable to confrontation. Data interoperability is often cited as a significant barrier to BIM adoption; there is a limited focus on other dimensions of interoperability. In other research areas, such as information systems and electronic government, the evolution of interoperability construct is debated beyond data interoperability. These dimensions of interoperability have yet to be explored in the AEC industry. This research article aims to introduce the BIM Interoperability Adoption Model (BIAM). For this purpose, we investigate the interoperability in multiple dimensions according to the European Interoperability framework and develop BIM Interoperability Model with factors affecting each interoperability dimension. BIAM offers a comprehensive assessment of technical, organizational, semantic, and legal interoperability in intra –organizational AEC units, inter-organizational AEC, and BIM partner organizations and assists as a model in assessing the level of compliance and maturity interoperability. BIAM is proposed to work as a link between the organizational, semantic, legal, and technical factors to determine the interoperability issues in the early stages of BIM adoption. The BIAM model addresses interoperability factors and provides recommendations and specifications to help AEC firms to collaborate more effectively by improving interoperability activities, organizational mapping processes, and improving legal coordination. Furthermore, opportunities for future research related to BIM interoperability are discussed, and addressing these aspects of interoperability will make collaborative project delivery well informed, more structured, and effective. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","129","","Comput Ind","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; Semantics; Architectural design; Information systems; Building Information Modelling; Interoperability framework; Information theory; Data interoperability; BIM adoption; BIM interoperability adoption model (BIAM); Building information modelling (BIM); Collaborative projects; Comprehensive assessment; Cost reduction; Electronic government; Interoperability dimensions; Interoperability modeling; Traditional architecture; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this article is to demonstrate, how semantic tools have been used to establish such platform. Semantic tools include thesauri. The Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus (CaLAThe) was issued in 2011 and based on the then draft version of the ISO LADM standard. CaLAThe was further developed to include also terms of the OGC LandInfra standard of 2016. The recent version (December 2019) integrates code list names and values, reflecting both the relevant Survey and Land division parts of LandInfra and, as proof of concept, some of the code lists mentioned in the Annex J Code lists of LADM. CaLAThe thus constitutes a shared universe of discourse, a frame for joint management of the code lists of the mentioned standards. Taking a problem-based approach to the design of artefacts like standards, the mentioned alignment of standards is part of a problem hierarchy. In this hierarchy, development of information standards provides a means for improving public administration, more specifically its aspects of e-government and interoperability. These aspects have spurred interest in semantic tools; for example, standardization organizations have recently publicized their terminological resources in terms of the ISO/TC211 Geolexica glossary and the OGC Definitions Server. The definitions of CaLAThe and the mentioned code lists are by December 2019 included into the OGC Definitions Server. Besides servicing the Land Administration communities, CaLAThe illustrates the use of thesauri as a cross-domain means for supporting the alignment of standards. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","104","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","Elsevier Ltd","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; knowledge; Alignment of standards; cadastre; Cadastre and Land Administration Thesaurus (CaLAThe); E-government; ISO LADM; Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS); land management; land tenure; OGC LandInfra/InfraGML; public administration; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The FED4IoT project is a research and innovation project that aims to develop a smart-city application, named 'VirIoT,' which realizes the semantic interoperability of IoT data among numerous IoT applications from different grounds. To realize the semantic interoperability of IoT data, data management on cloud platforms, such as FIWARE, is considered necessary. Therefore, the development of a root data domain gateway (RDG), which analyzes IoT data, converts its data format, and posts the data to the cloud service, is required. In this project, Kanazawa Institute of Technology has chosen wildlife monitoring as one of the use cases of the project, and its system using IoT has been designed and developed. Furthermore, its data model has been created for the development of the RDG.

As new capabilities and assets become available and as current Command and Control (C2) systems become older, border control practitioners are faced with the increasing challenge of how to integrate new assets, command and control all of them in a coordinated and coherent way without having to invest in a completely new C2 systems built from the ground up.

However, while digitizing public services processes for Moroccan administrations, the designers of information systems record the entered data in databases, without being too interested in the meaning of the entries made by citizens nor on the benefit of exchanged information between public administrations. This causes inconsistency and lack of interoperability between public administration systems. Moreover, the systems require information collection and shared knowledge based on a common vocabulary of public services in Morocco. For this purpose, this paper presents an ontology model based on the 5w1h Method for defining the public services domain. This PSOM ontology is based on the referential defined by the Moroccan Ministry of Administration Reform and Public service.

This paper proposes an ontology-based framework for regulatory-compliance management that provides an integrated view of the law architecture model, public enterprise model, and BP lifecycle to enable the design of compliance solutions that cover the full business process compliance lifecycle, i.e., design time, runtime, and offline monitoring and analysis. The proposed framework is based on an integrated semantic model representing the business process model and administrative laws concepts which provide a shared conceptualization of the BP activities and the related legal rules.

For the geospatial domain common models such as INSPIRE have been established in the European Union. The United Nations initiative on Global Geospatial Information Management (UN-GGIM) draws together national and regional capacities. Interoperability is the main principle behind these initiatives. Nonetheless there is a lack of published research to date on mapping agency geospatial linked data leveraging the UN-GGIM taxonomy of information management data themes. Thus, we have identified use cases and defined a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)[3] taxonomy expressing the UN-GGIM data themes for national spatial infrastructure. This has been applied in a metadata generation and reporting tool for Ordnance Survey Ireland (OSi) which underpinned improved governance and reporting infrastructure in OSi. This demonstrated the contribution of Semantic Web technology to spatial data governance as well as its importance for data publishing. This paper presents a documented open license SKOS taxonomy for the UN-GGIM data themes that follows Linked Data best practices. It provides a set of three use cases, an overview of UN-GGIM theme definitions and an example application of the taxonomy for deployment in OSi for DCAT metadata generation and data publishing pipeline reporting. © © 2021 for this paper by its authors.

We validate the usefulness of this approach by supporting route compatibility checks, a highly demanded use case in this domain, which was not available over the agency’s registries before. Our contributions include (i) an official ontology for the railway infrastructure and authorized vehicle types, including 28 reference datasets; (ii) a reusable Knowledge Graph describing the European railway infrastructure; (iii) a cost-efficient system architecture that enables high-flexibility for use case development; and (iv) an open source and RDF native Web application to support route compatibility checks. This work demonstrates how data-centric system design, powered by Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles, provides a framework to achieve data interoperability and unlock new and innovative use cases and applications. Based on the results obtained during this work, ERA officially decided to make Semantic Web and Linked Data-based approaches, the default setting for any future development of the data, registers and specifications under the agency’s remit for data exchange mandated by the EU legal framework. The next steps, which are already underway, include further developing and bringing these solutions to a production-ready state. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","648-664","","","12922 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Ambitious goals, including those set by the European Union, foster the increased use of distributed generation, essentially based on renewable energy sources. This requires major changes in electricity markets and energy systems, namely through the adoption of the smart grid paradigm. The use of simulation tools and the study of different market mechanisms and the relationships between their stakeholders are essential. One of the main challenges in this area is developing decision support tools to address the problem as a whole. This work contributes to increasing interoperability between heterogeneous systems, namely agent-based, directed to the study of electricity markets, the operation of smart grid, and energy management. To this end, this work proposes the use of ontologies to ease the interaction between entities of different natures and the use of semantic web technologies to develop more intelligent and flexible tools. A multiagent systems society, composed of several heterogeneous multiagent systems, which interact using the proposed ontologies, is presented as a proof-of-concept. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","215-226","","","1472 CCIS","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

Based on the theories and methods of the semantic web and semantic ontology construction, we summarize the relevant domain knowledge of government archives and construct the Chinese Government Archive Ontology (GAO) with the collection of government archives as the data. The ontology model implements the semantic interoperability between government archives and performs knowledge representation and reasoning on their content. We define the classes and properties of GAO, describe its creation process in detail, and demonstrate its applicability in practice through SPARQL query and event logical representation based on the 5W1H framework.

The ITIP is based on the use of Semantic Web technologies to integrate a number of data sources, particularly including the bibliographic records of a museum. Moreover, an ontology model was developed to help users search cultural collections by topic concepts. Design/methodology/approach: Two issues were identified that needed to be addressed: the integration of heterogeneous data sources and semantic-based information retrieval. Two corresponding methods were proposed: SPARQL federated queries were designed for data integration across the Web and ontology-driven queries were designed to semantically search by knowledge inference. Furthermore, to help users perform searches easily, three searching interfaces, namely, ethnicity, region and topic, were developed to take full advantage of the content available on the Web. Findings: Most open government data provides structured but non-resource description framework data, Semantic Web consumers, therefore, require additional data conversion before the data can be used. On the other hand, although the library, archive and museum (LAM) community has produced some emerging linked data, very few data sets are released to the general public as open data. The Semantic Web’s vision of “web of data” remains challenging. Originality/value: This study developed data integration from various institutions, including those of the LAM community. The development was conducted based on the mode of non-institution members (i.e. institutional outsiders). The challenges encountered included uncertain data quality and the absence of institutional participation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","337-353","","2","39","","Electron.

This would provide clinicians (A Clinician is a healthcare professional who deals directly with a patient, such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, specialists and first responders.) with a holistic view of all patient data. Combined with increases in patient data generated by advances in medical devices, it allows the extract of more information increasing recall, but it requires great cognitive effort to identify relevant information. This additional effort will exasperate the impact of the trend of decreasing time clinicians have to interact with their patients. It raises the risk to clinicians of cognitive overload. This paper proposes a solution that presents clinicians with the most relevant patient healthcare data based on the clinicians role and the healthcare scenario. The goal is to provide the clinician a more efficient method to determine the proper treatment.

Controlled Vocabularies (CVs) provide a key to disclosing the potential of Open Government data, by supplying common terms for marking up metadata and data in a consistent and coherent way. However, quality information is needed to help public institutions decide whether to adopt an existing or newly created CV. The paper discusses how to evaluate and document CV quality thus facilitating a comparison of different controlled vocabularies based on contextual information. The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to assess the overall quality and rank of a controlled vocabulary, by integrating various quality dimensions according to the decision maker's needs. A set of e-Government controlled vocabularies that facilitate the semantic interoperability of e-Government data are selected as a testbed, and updated quality values are made available as Linked Data. Multi-step guidelines are also defined promoting and complementing the adoption of W3C recommendations to provide machine-readable quality metadata. This fosters reliability and re-usability by providing consumers with information on the assessment process carried out and the outcomes achieved. We illustrate the application of these guidelines by focusing on provenance and quality documentation. © 2013 IEEE.","2021","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","144-160","","1","9","","IEEE Trans.

The management of privacy preferences across these devices is a complex task for which users are ill-equipped, which increases privacy risks. In this paper we propose an approach that exploits Semantic Web (SW) technology to manage the user's IoT privacy preferences and negotiate the permissions for data sharing with third parties. SW technology comprises a web of data that can be processed by machines through a formal, universally shared representation. In our approach, SW enables a lightweight and interoperable communication between a Personal Data Manager (PDM) and the Third Parties (TPs) that request access to the user's personal data. The PDM can handle multiple heterogeneous personal IoT devices and manages the negotiation process between the user and the TPs in a way that can relieve users from the burden of specifying their privacy requirement for each TP. The core of the approach is the definition of the Privacy Preference for IoT (PPIoT) Ontology which is based on the Privacy Preference Ontology, the W3C Semantic Sensor Network Ontology, the Fair Information Practices (FIP) principles, and state-of-the-art recommendation techniques for privacy protection in the IoT. This ontology aims to capture the complexity of privacy management in the IoT paradigm in light of the recent General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union. Along with presenting the ontology, in this paper we will provide an example on how to use the PPIoT ontology for the management of privacy preferences in the fitness IoT domain and we will show how the PDM handles the process of negotiation between the user and the TPs. The approach is based on an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model (PPM) that meets the requirements of the GDPR to have transparent and simple TP privacy policies. Finally, we will report the results of an evaluation on a mockup fitness app that implements this PPM. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) to propose an ontology for privacy preference in the IoT context, which covers a knowledge gap in existing literature and can be used for IoT privacy management, (ii) to propose an interactive PPIoT-based Privacy Preference Model, which is in accordance with the GDPR objectives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","2020","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","879-898","","","111","","Future Gener Comput Syst","","","","","","Elsevier B.V.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Ontology; Data Sharing; Data privacy; IoT; Internet of things; Complex networks; Data sharing and permission management; Fair information practices; General data protection regulations; Interoperable communications; Managers; Privacy ontology; Privacy Preference Manager; Privacy preferences; Privacy requirements; Pulse width modulation; Recommendation techniques; Sensor networks; Shared representations; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The implementation of cross- border exchange of IPS is among the highest priorities of the European commission. Detailed functional requirements and use cases have been elaborated in addition to a new IPS standard in recent years as part of the efforts for enabling interoperability in information exchange and continuity of care. This paper presents a practicable approach and a solution to the problem of achieving semantic interoperability among the IPS sources in the European union. A novelty approach in this paper is first to design and analyze the business process of the primary use case and after that to propose a solution. It allows to identify several activities that are out of the scope in the existing documents and at the same time require special attention at the stage of software implementation. The proposed solution makes use of the openEHR information model to represent the IPS standard dataset in terms of archetypes. This way we preserve the semantic context in clinical concepts as well as introduce interoperability among data providers. Moreover, it overcomes the severe drawback of the message paradigm, where every two communicating parties must apply transformation of existing data that is specific to their needs. The discussion considers a computer experiment with real data employing a fully functional web application for IPS cross-border exchange. © Proceedings of the 12th IADIS International Conference e-Health 2020, EH 2020 - Part of the 14th Multi Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems, MCCSIS 2020.

To this purpose, we introduce ResearchFlow, an approach that integrates semantic technologies and machine learning to quantifying the diachronic behaviour of research topics across academia and industry. ResearchFlow exploits the novel Academia/Industry DynAmics (AIDA) Knowledge Graph in order to characterize each topic according to the frequency in time of the related i) publications from academia, ii) publications from industry, iii) patents from academia, and iv) patents from industry. This representation is then used to produce several analytics regarding the academia/industry knowledge flow and to forecast the impact of research topics on industry. We applied ResearchFlow to a dataset of 3.5M papers and 2M patents in Computer Science and highlighted several interesting patterns. We found that 89.8% of the topics first emerge in academic publications, which typically precede industrial publications by about 5.6 years and industrial patents by about 6.6 years. However this does not mean that academia always dictates the research agenda. In fact, our analysis also shows that industrial trends tend to influence academia more than academic trends affect industry. We evaluated ResearchFlow on the task of forecasting the impact of research topics on the industrial sector and found that its granular characterization of topics improves significantly the performance with respect to alternative solutions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","219-236","","","12387 LNAI","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Data service is a critical component for OGD which guarantees the availability of government data to users in the form of structured and machine-readable open datasets. Aspects such as usability, quality, and interoperability should be considered in building such open datasets. The diversity of data sets usually hampers unlocking the full potential value of data. Interoperability addresses the ability of open data platforms and data services to communicate, exchange and consume data, and to operate effectively together. To tackle this issue, in this paper, we propose an ontology-based technique enabling governmental organizations to identify their public data and publish them via well-defined interoperable data services. In this context, an Open Governmental Data Platform including a portal (www.iranopendata.ir) and a data management system (www.ogdms.iranopendata.ir) is designed and developed to fulfill this goal. As a case study, the constructed platform has been utilized and evaluated in the Tehran Municipality organization. The results show that applying the proposed approach leads to the creation of high-quality datasets achieving a high degree of interoperability. © 2020 IEEE.","2020","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

The urgency of the task directed on managing the economic systems innovative development in current competitive market conditions is substantiated. Existing approaches and tools to modeling and decision support in strategic management of the developed territorial systems are considered. The paper also introduces an approach to the knowledge base development for intellectual decision support in innovative project management, based on the ontological analysis of knowledge acquisition from various sources. The effective tools to forming the strategic planning innovative system at the regional level, which could ensure the integration of potential innovative projects and programs in the existing model of the reproduction process are presented. One of the main properties of knowledge management systems is emergence, due to which the interaction between specialists based on formalization of knowledge representation and processing in intellectual components development (ontology, knowledge base) contributes to the creation of new knowledge. An advantage of the ontology-based approach to innovation process management is the semantic integration of data and knowledge for the decision support system. It is proposed on the basis of ontological engineering to form a comprehensive tool to development of an integrated model for representing and processing of knowledge at various stages of the innovative projects management process. Further study logic involves development of an integrated ontology that combines a set of ontologies formed to describe the various fields of specialists knowledge in the field of innovative project management, which will provide a clear understanding of the subject concepts, as well as the rules and cases of decision-making based on them. The proposed approach to organizing the intellectual decision support system is focused on the use of public administration in determining the parameters of medium-Term development of the Russian Federation, as well as in development of measures and mechanisms for social, economic and budgetary policy. Increasing the degree of scientific validity and accuracy of the forecast estimates will reduce the risks in adoption and implementation of management decisions. In theoretical aspect it is proposed to develop at the regional level the territorial systems management models and to form the scientific foundation for further development and comprehensive utilization technology of adaptive management and imitation based on modern intelligent information technologies applied for solving the problem of strategies and programs justification in innovative development in Russian regions. © 2019 IEEE.","2019","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","384-387","","","2019-September","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - Int.

Legislation metadata is thus viewed as a global graph of interconnected entities. While ELI tries to lower the entry barrier for legal publishers to disseminate structured metadata and currently counts 13 implementations, it is also facing challenges to progress towards its full potential: data quality, description of ELI datasets, alignment of thematic vocabularies or granular description of the text subdivisions. ELI has the potential to facilitate access to legal information by enabling unambiguous legal citations mark-up, giving legislation more visibility in major web search engines, describing early legislation drafts or facilitating the exchange of data between legal information systems. ELI is tightly connected to novel legal information system architectures, based on legal knowledge graphs; this style of architecture encourages legal publishers to move from a document-centric perspective towards a data-centric perspective, as exemplified by the Casemates in Luxembourg and the Cellar at the Office of Publications of the European Union. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.","2019","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","137-148","","","317","","","","","","","","IOS Press BV","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Front.

Boundaries between public and private services are blurring, enabling government and private sector to collaborate and share responsibilities. In Belgium, the regional Government of Flanders embedded the re-use of public sector information in its legislation and published a data portal containing well over 4000 Open Datasets. Due to a lack of interoperability, interconnecting and interpreting these sources of information remain challenges for public administrations, businesses and citizens. To dissolve the boundaries between the data silos, the Flemish government applied Linked Data design principles in an operational public sector context. This paper discusses the trends we have identified while ‘rewiring’ the Authentic Source for addresses to a Linked Base Registry. We observed the impact on multiple interoperability levels; namely on the legal, organisational, semantic and technical level. In conclusion Linked Data can increase semantic and technical interoperability and lead to a better adoption of government information in the public and private sector. We strongly believe that the insights from the past thirteen years in the region of Flanders could speed up processes in other countries that are facing the complexity of raising technical and semantic interoperability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2019","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","86-101","","","55","","J.

These included different data policies, encodings, formats and semantics, to name a few. Data was collected for, and applied to, domain specific use cases and comprehensive standards did not exist, all impacting on the re-usability of such public sector data. To release the potential of spatial data held by public authorities and improve evidence-based environmental policy making, action was needed at all levels (Local, Regional, National, European) to introduce more effective data and information management and to make data available for citizens’ interest. The INSPIRE Directive, the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe, directly addresses this set of problems. The Directive came into force on 15 May 2007, with full implementation in every EU Member State required by 2021. It combines both, a legal and a technical framework for the EU Member States, to make relevant spatial data accessible and reused. Specifically, this has meant making data discoverable and interoperable through a common set of standards, data models and Internet services. The Directive’s data scope covers 34 themes of cross-sector relevance as a decentralised infrastructure where data remains at the place it can be best maintained. A great deal of experience has been gained by public administrations through its implementation. Due to its complexity and wide scope, this is taking place in a stepwise manner, with benefits already emerging as important deadlines approached. Efficient and effective coordination are following the participatory approach established in its design. It is timely to reflect on 10 years of progress of the “cultural change” which the European Spatial Data Infrastructure represents. We therefore, consider the lessons INSPIRE is offering for those interested in joined-up and federated approaches to geospatial data-sharing and semantic interoperability across borders and sectors. The approach itself is evolving through this experience. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","2019","2026-01-17 07:02:47","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","63-84","","","2019","","","","","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Most of the data and statistics made available on government web sites are aggregate, however, until now, we have not had a suitable linked data representation available. We propose a way to express summary statistics across aggregate groups as linked data using Web Ontology Language (OWL) Class based sets, where members of the set contribute to the overall aggregate value. Additionally, many clinical studies in the biomedical field rely on demographic summaries of their study cohorts and the patients assigned to each arm. While most data query languages, including SPARQL, allow for computation of summary statistics, they do not provide a way to integrate those values back into the RDF graphs they were computed from. We represent this knowledge, that would otherwise be lost, through the use of OWL 2 punning semantics, the expression of aggregate grouping criteria as OWL classes with variables, and constructs from the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO), and the World Wide Web Consortium’s provenance ontology, PROV-O, providing interoperable representations that are well supported across the web of Linked Data. We evaluate these semantics using a Resource Description Framework (RDF) representation of patient case information from the Genomic Data Commons, a data portal from the National Cancer Institute. © © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

Aggregation of urban data according to multiple perspectives through the definition of proper indicators enables urban data exploration at different granularity levels for distinct categories of users. Furthermore, Semantic Web technologies may be used to enable interoperability and improve data access.

A wide range of heterogeneous data is managed by different stakeholders, thus demanding solutions to support integration issues such as interoperability and ambiguity. In a previous work, we proposed an ontology for Emergency Response Systems, called EDXL-RESCUER, in the scope of the RESCUER project. In this paper, we present the usage of this ontology in a data exchange solution (DILS: Data Integration with Legacy Systems), which aims to provide semantic interoperability between Emergency Response Systems, and the evolution of EDXL-RESCUER. To evaluate the proposed solution, EDXL-RESCUER & DILS, we performed two studies: (i) simulations using two real data sources, the Police Reports from Bahia Public Safety and Security Department, Brazil; and the Canadian Disaster Database; (ii) an emergency simulation at an Industrial Park in Bahia, Brazil. The results demonstrate the potential use of the EDXL-RESCUER as a common vocabulary to support semantic interoperability between emergency response systems. We also verified the feasibility of using the DILS solution in emergency management scenarios.

The primary and permanent core of this platform is data, and it is the data ready for the information sharing and the provision of seamless public services. Growing digital world has formed the culture of interaction between government and society based on Open Data. The great importance has the ability of consumers to understand the meaning (semantics) determined by the provider, which is essential for the publication of Linked Open Data. The application and dissemination of data models serve for adequate semantic interpretation during information sharing and aim to achieve semantic interoperability. Both data-centric and model-oriented approaches are fundamental for the digital transformation of public administration. In this paper, we give a brief review of the leading countries digitalization experience and use it to outline the criteria characterizing the implementation of a data-centric paradigm. We have conducted the study showing if Russian e-government is ready for the digitalization in terms of the following areas: (1) the practice of information sharing; (2) the preconditions for the shift to a data-centric and model-oriented paradigm; (3) the regulatory barriers of digital transformation. We believe that the lack of data-centricity can become a serious obstacle to fulfill the plans of the “Digital Economy of Russian Federation” program. Therefore, we give some recommendations to introduce the data-centric approach that would enable the use of disruptive digital technologies and support the development of digital government in Russia. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","2019","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","439-454","","","947","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

In this paper, we focus on how the Semantic Web technologies are used to convert CSV data into RDF. Therefore, we present a method and techniques to parse the CSV file; the parsed CSV data are complemented with metadata annotations to generate the annotated tabular data model which is then converted into RDF triples. According to the conceptual correspondences between the CSV data model and RDF data model, we designed a set of algorithms to generate RDF triples from the CSV data. Our developed prototype tool, CSV2RDF, is used for evaluating the performance of the proposed method through real-world CSV datasets.

However, it is very difficult to make sense between data from two different data sets or different domains. As a result a lot of time is spent in just collecting and linking this data from various sources before it can be put to use. A potential solution to this problem is using a Common Data Model. A Common Data Model is a data silo or warehouse which can accommodate any data from any source in one pre-designed format. In this paper we discuss an ETL process that allows users to remodel and store data, and a proposed schema for a Common Data Model which will house this transformed data under one roof. We also perform our own analysis on the proposed data model for a particular use-case; state-wise statistics of data related to pregnancy in India. Thus we prove that the common data model is able to integrate data from different sources and facilitate cross domain analysis and linking of data. © 2018 IEEE.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","1450-1457","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: IEEE Int.

A set of geospatial data and process standard specifications from Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International Standardization Organization (ISO) have been adopted to facilitate interoperable sharing of and access to data amongst organizational data nodes and end-users. Standards-based Web Map Services (WMS) are accessible from data providing agencies for use in the development of GIS applications. Efforts are afoot to reengineer and maintain available data sets for provision of Web Feature Services (WFS) for improving access to processable feature data sets with stakeholders. Collaborative preparation and maintenance of an authoritative, seamless and nationally consistent set of high-resolution National Foundation Spatial Data (NFSD) has been an important priority for NSDI to overcome problems in integration of data sets from multiple data nodes. Several national- and state-level policies have been in place to provide the required governance framework. Delays in data cleaning and reengineering; inefficient data/metadata update; absence of registry and catalogue service to support search and discovery; nonavailability of a common application development platform; delays in onboarding of data services/applications; insecurity of the cyberspace; lack of technical capacity amongst end-users; and absence of skilled personnel for building and maintaining data nodes have been some of the impediments before NSDI’s effective utilization. National Data Registry (NDR) to support registration, search and discovery of data services; application development on a cloud-based processing platform; development of ontologies for ensuring semantic interoperability amongst data nodes; and deployment of advanced cybersecurity tools for preventing cyberattacks; and R&D in geospatial ontologies, 3D SDI and geoanalytics constitute a part of the NSDI’s strategy for the future. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","7-16","","","","","","","","","","","Springer Singapore","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Geospatial Infrastructure, Applications and Technologies: India Case Studies","","","","Bureau of indian standards (BIS); ISO standards; OGC specifications; Service-oriented architecture (SOA); Spatial data infrastructures (SDI); Web feature services (WFS); Web map services (WMS); LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

PMKI aims to share maintainable and sustainable Language Resources making them interoperable in order to support language technology industry, and public administrations, with multilingual tools able to improve cross border accessibility of digital services. The paper focuses on the main feature (interoperability) that represents the specificity of PMKI platform distinguishing it from other existing frameworks. In particular it aims to create a set of tools and facilities, based on Semantic Web technologies, to establish semantic interoperability between multilingual lexicons. Such task requires to harmonize in general multilingual language resources using standardised representation with respect to a defined core data model under an adequate architecture. A comparative study among the main data models for representing lexicons and recommendations for the PMKI service was required as well. Moreover, synergies with other programs of the EU institutions, as far as systems interoperability and Machine Translation (MT) solutions, are foreseen. For instance some interactions are foreseen between PMKI and MT service provided by the EC but also with other NLP applications. © LREC 2018 - 11th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation.

As a result, the names of crops are messy and sometimes inconsistent. It is problematic in the digital and Internet era since interoperability is not assured. In this paper, we proposes Crop Vocabulary (CVO) as the core vocabulary of crop names to solve interoperability and machine-readability on crop names. There are many vocabularies about crops by various food chain stakeholders. Here we picked up three vocabularies issued by Japanese government with respect to food security, namely the Agricultural chemical use reference, the Agricultural chemical residue reference, and the Food composition database, since food security is the primary concern of all food chain stakeholders including farmers and consumers. As the result of comparative analysis of these vocabularies, we defined the concept of crop as the botanical information such as the scientific name of species with additional information such as edible parts, cultivation methods and usage. According to the definition, we investigated these three vocabularies and identified 1,249 crops with unique names. The element of CVO contains the information about the crop itself such as synonym, English name and scientific name as well as links to names in the above-mentioned vocabularies and other external vocabularies such as Wikipedia, AGROVOC and NCBI Taxonomy. We develop web-based API for CVO and an application for the farm management as an example. The value of CVO as a core vocabulary in the field of agriculture is identified by compatibility with existing vocabularies and its usefulness is demonstrated by web services applications developed based on CVO. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","320-335","","","11341 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Currently, a topical issue is to unite these information systems, create favourable conditions for their information interaction. This task is particularly important for the creation of an information infrastructure in the electronic government, which involves both large-scale state systems and applications automating local functions. The main part of system interoperability is defined by semantics – tools for transfer of meaningful data, information. Semantics in information space is defined by two components: identification of objects and NameSpace. In different information spaces the problem of semantics provision is solved in a customized way. In semantic web, it is possible to use standard NameSpaces, or create your own one. An automatically generated URI is used as identifiers. There are alternative options to reproduce semantics in the framework of information infrastructure. In practice, there are cases where identifiers are a profound business key containing information about individual elements of business logic, the result of which is the object described. The article describes examples of such practice and shows elements of the methodology for creating such identifiers. The second semantics element is the namespace. In this field, serious groundwork has been made in different economy sectors. There is a tendency of interaction between separate dictionaries and development of uniform approaches. This can be implemented through creation of templates. Currently, the prerequisites for combination of two elements of semantics definition are fulfilled: identifiers and namespaces. This would make it possible to move quickly towards the creation of an e-government information infrastructure. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","78-89","","","858","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Commun.

The main objective of the project is to realize the content-based search of Earth Observation (EO) images on an application specific basis. The satellite images, which come from EO satellites such as Sentinels 1, 2 and 3, as well as ENVISAT, are distributed with few correlated meta-data which do not describe the phenomena and the objects included in the image. Innovative approaches to process remote sensing images can extract relevant information which semantically describes the land type, the region area border, objects and events such as oil spill. This information can be modeled as structured information through ontologies to be processed by algorithms to perform information retrieval and filtering. The proposed system is aware of the semantic elements which are relevant for final user and will be able to answer natural language queries such as ""Show me the images of the Mediterranean Sea which include an algal bloom"". The possibility to retrieve a specific set of land images starting from a query expressed by a final user can quickly increase the interoperability and the diffusion of applications able to efficiently use EO data. In this work, we present a brief overview of the most successful application of this formalization strategy focusing on the tools and approaches for creating a robust and efficient domain geo-ontology. Furthermore, we describe the approach adopted to define the specific ontology used in the SEO-DWARF project, including the strategy adopted for implementing and populating it. © 2018 SPIE.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","10773","","","","","","","","SPIE spie@spie.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng","","","","Semantic Web; Ontology; Query processing; Earth observation data; Earth Observation data; Electrooptical devices; Geodetic satellites; Image retrieval; Information filtering; Information retrieval and filtering; Innovative approaches; Natural language processing systems; Natural language queries; Observatories; Oil spills; Question Answering; Remote sensing; Remote sensing images; Semantic representation; Structured information; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","Themistocleous, K.; Michaelides, S.; Ambrosia, V.; Papadavid, G.; Hadjimitsis, D.G.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Proceedings of SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fostering smart city innovation at local and regional level requires a set of mature technologies to discover, integrate and harmonize multiple data sources and the exposure of effective applications for end-users (citizens, administrators, tourists..). In this context, Semantic Web technologies and Linked Open Data principles provide a means for sharing knowledge about cities as physical, economical, social, and technical systems, enabling the development of smart city services. Despite the tremendous effort these communities have done so far, there exists a lack of comprehensive and effective platforms that handle the entire process of identification, ingestion, consumption and publication of data for Smart Cities. In this paper, a complete open-source platform to boost the integration, semantic enrichment, publication and exploitation of public data to foster smart cities in local and national administrations is proposed. Starting from mature software solutions, we propose a platform to facilitate the harmonization of datasets (open and private, static and dynamic on real time) of the same domain generated by different authorities. The platform provides a unified dataset oriented to smart cities that can be exploited to offer services to the citizens in a uniform way, to easily release open data, and to monitor services status of the city in real time by means of a suite of web applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","2018","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","171-176","","","10546 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag service@springer.de","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Taxonomies based on hand made directory hierarchies still remain the only possible alternative for most small and medium enterprises, public administrations and individual users. However, both the limitations of the hierarchical organization of file systems and the difficulty of maintaining the coherence within the taxonomy have raised the need for more scalable and effective approaches. Desktop searching applications provide proprietary interfaces that enable content-based searching at the cost of having no control on the indexing and ranking of results. Semantic file systems, instead, leave users the freedom to manage the taxonomy according to their specific needs, but lose the standard file system features. In this paper we describe GFS (graph-based file system) a new hybrid file system that extends the standard hierarchical organization of files with semantic features. GFS allows the user to nest semantic spaces inside the directory hierarchy leaving unaltered system folders. Semantic spaces allow customized file tagging and leverage on browsing to guide file searching. Since GFS does not change the low-level interface to interact with file systems, users can continue to use their favorite file managers to interact with it. Moreover, no changes are required to integrate the semantic features in proprietary software. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","51-55","","","Part F128274","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

The models help define structures of knowledge components and their relationship among them within a problem domain that may provide better representation of a system design architecture. Such basic model of knowledge components can provide a transparent approach for enhancing design thinking and comprehension for both users and system developers. This makes the ontology technique as one of the prominent techniques for designing system solution in a context-sensitive manner. In this paper, we describe the use of ontology in two design cases for representing the problem universe of discourse. First design case is on a record management system and second case is on a decision support system. For both system design cases, the ontology technique provided benefits for gaining semantic integration and interoperability in designing the solutions. Findings from our studies suggest that ontology enables provisions both to end users and to system developers for achieving design goals that in turn maximize various user benefits. © 2016 IEEE.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","148-153","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc. - IEEE Int.

Requirements for a decision support system are used as a starting point at its design stage and determine the functions of the developed system without showing the mechanism of its implementation. At the same time, the requirements serve as constraints in the process of system development. The set of the developed requirements for the decision support system includes basic, functional, non-functional and economic requirements. We propose to use the ontological approach in the development of requirements for the system. This allows us to solve a number of problems arising from the description of the requirements in natural language: the lack of exposition clarity, misrepresentation of the requirements and so on. The ontological model allows developers to interpret the requirements in the same way, to structure the specification of requirements for the system and to eliminate blurring in their definitions. Ontological representation of knowledge about requirements for the developed system and about the system providing public services in general is used for the semantic integration of existing information resources, appropriate interpretation of the content of text documents and search queries presented in a natural language. The developed ontology improves the quality of user (stakeholder) interaction during the system operation. In addition, it includes rules for term combination to provide reliable assertions on the state of the decision support system. © 2020 National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","36-47","","1","","","Bus. inform.","Разработка требований к системе поддержки принятия решений для оценки качества предоставления государственных услуг с применением онтологического подхода2","","","","","National Research University, Higher School of Econoimics","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Basic requirements; Decision support system; Economic requirements; Functional requirements; Non-functional requirements; Ontological model for decision support; Quality assessment of public services provided; System of providing public services; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RDF ontologies were developed to break apart the government data silos and stimulate data reuse. However, ontology design still encounters a number of difficulties. Since domain experts are generally unfamiliar with RDF, a design process is needed that allows these experts to efficiently contribute to intermediate ontology prototypes. We designed the OSLO2 ontologies using UML, a modeling language well known within the government, as a single source specification. From this source, the ontology and other relevant documents are generated. This paper describes the conversion tooling and the pragmatic approaches that were taken into account in its design.

Firstly, the government service domain is analysed and domain ontology is constructed to capture its semantic content. Thereafter, a semiformal representation of the domain ontology is created with the ontology knowledge-based editor Protégé. Finally, the OWL ontology model is imported. This study aims at providing e-government developers, particularly those from the developing world, with an easy-to-use framework for practising semantic knowledge representation in e-government processes, thus facilitating the design of e-government systems that can be easily integrated and maintained. The other challenge when integrating information systems in any domain such as e-government is the challenge of interoperability. One can distinguish between three levels of interoperability: technical, semantic, and organisational. The technical aspect has been widely tackled especially after the ubiquity of internet technologies. © © 2017 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","1-18","","1","12","","Int.

Linked Open Data (LOD) refers to a set of best practices that empower enterprises to publish and interlink their data using existing ontologies on the World Wide Web. Current research in LOD focuses on expert search, the creation of unified information space and augmentation of core data from an enterprise context. However, existing approaches for publication of enterprise data as LOD are domain-specific, ad-hoc and suffer from lack of uniform representation across domains. The paper proposes a novel methodology called LinkED that contributes towards LOD literature in two ways: (a) streamlines the publishing process through five stages of cleaning, triplification, interlinking, storage and visualization; (b) addresses the latest challenges in LOD publication, namely: inadequate links, inconsistencies in the quality of the dataset and replicability of the LOD publication process. Further, the methodology is demonstrated via the publication of digital repository data as LOD in a university setting, which is evaluated based on two semantic standards: Five-Star model and data quality metrics. Overall, the paper provides a generic LOD publication process that is applicable across various domains such as healthcare, e-governance, banking, and tourism, to name a few.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","191-209","","3","25","","J.

Two frameworks that provide support for the proposed composition method are also described in this paper: Linkedator, which is responsible for connecting entities managed by microservices, and Alignator, which aligns semantic concepts defined by heterogeneous ontologies. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed method is based on entity linking principles and uses individual matching techniques considering a formal notion of identity. This method imposes two major constraints that must be taken into account by its implementation: architectural constraints and resource design constraints. Findings: Experiments were performed in a real-world scenario, using public government data. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and that, it leverages the independence of development and composability of microservices. Thereby, the data provided by microservices that adopt heterogeneous ontologies can now be linked together. Research limitations/implications: This work only considers microservices designed as data providers. Microservices designed to execute functionalities in a given application domain are out of the scope of this work. Originality/value: The proposed composition method exploits the potential data intersection observed in resource-oriented microservice descriptions, providing a navigable view of data provided by a set of interrelated microservices. Furthermore, this study explores the applicability of ontology alignments for composing microservices. © 2017 Emerald Publishing Limited.","2017","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","302-323","","3","13","","Int.

To handle this challenge, data models are typically developed to characterize and manage the data generated, used, and stored by a given enterprise. Unfortunately, different data providers employ qualitatively different data models, and this gives rise to problems exchanging data across organizational boundaries. Over the past decade, these problems have motivated data producers and consumers to look toward standardized data exchange models to address data interoperability. In this paper we examine some of these standardized data exchange models and compare them with a new type of data model based on ontologies. Ontology models have emerged in recent years from a confluence of research in the artificial intelligence, semantic web, and information science communities. This paper introduces ontology models, provides several use cases for ontologies relevant to aviation data management, and summarizes state-of-the-art aviation prototype applications that utilize ontologies. © 2016 IEEE.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","2016-December","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: AIAA IEEE Dig Avionics Syst Conf Proc","","","","Interoperability; Ontology; Information management; ontologies; Electronic data interchange; Data interoperability; data interoperability; Government agencies; State of the art; Data structures; aviation data management; Avionics; Data exchange models; data models; Data producers; Digital avionics; Model-based OPC; Organizational boundaries; Service provider; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the same time citizens expect that these governmental levels adopt a user-centric approach and provide instant access to their data or to open government data. Therefore the applications at various government levels need to be interoperable in support of the 'once only-principle': data is inputted and registered only once and then reused. Given government budget constraints and the cost and complexity of (re)modeling, translating and transforming data over and over, public administrations need to reduce interoperability costs. This is achieved by semantically aligning information between the different information systems of each government level. Semantical interoperable systems facilitate citizen-centered e-government services. This paper illustrates how the Open Standards for Linked Organizations program (OSLO) paved the way bottom-up from a broad basis of stakeholders towards a government-endorsed strategy. OSLO applied a generic process and methodology and provided practical insights on how to overcome the encountered hurdles: political support and adoption; reaching semantic agreement. The lessons learned in the region of Flanders (Belgium) can speed-up the process in other countries that face the complexity of integrating information intensive processes between different applications, administrations and government levels.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","126-134","","","22-23-November-2016","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

In 2013 a working group was formed under the largest infrastructure for health in Europe, Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI-ERIC), with the remit to continue the development of MIABIS (version 2.0) through a multicountry governance process. MIABIS 2.0 Core has been developed with 22 attributes describing Biobanks, Sample Collections, and Studies according to a modular structure that makes it easier to adhere to and to extend the standard. This integration standard will make a great contribution to the discovery and exploitation of biobank resources and lead to a wider and more efficient use of valuable bioresources, thereby speeding up the research on human diseases. Many within the European Union have accepted MIABIS 2.0 Core as the ""de facto"" biobank information standard. © Copyright 2016, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","298-306","","4","14","","","","","","","","Mary Ann Liebert Inc. info@liebertpub.com","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Biopreservation Biobanking","","","","human; Humans; Databases, Factual; factual database; European Union; information processing; priority journal; biobank; Biological Specimen Banks; Conference Paper; data base; health care facility; information dissemination; Information Dissemination; medical information system; medical research; minimum information about biobank data sharing; organization and management; software; Software; specimen handling; Specimen Handling; standards; teleconference; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Biopreservation and Biobanking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The information systems are designed and developed by different organizations to be autonomous and heterogeneous sources which lead to multiple structuring formats and different interpretations of the same data. So to simplify data access, the virtual integration of heterogeneous, autonomous and distributed data sources is required based on the couple mediator-wrapper and founded on ontologies that provide a consensual terminology. The mediator masks the heterogeneity and distributes the data sources, while the adapter accommodates queries to data sources formats. Information systems exchange data and services thanks to the rich context that the semantic web offers. It aims to provide data understandable by humans and machines that perform automatic processing by software modules following a semantic enrichment.

The lack of common data standards (common data models and reference data) for exchanging information between administrations in a cross-domain and/or cross-border setting stands in the way of digital public services and automated flow of information between public administrations. Core data models address this issue, but are often created within the closed environment of a country or region and within one policy domain. A lack of insight exists in understanding and managing the life-cycle of these initiatives on public administration information systems for data modelling and data exchange. In this paper, we outline state-of-the-art implementations and vocabularies linked to the core data models. In particular we inventoried and selected existing core data models and identified tendencies in current practices based on the criteria creation, use, maintenance and coordination. Based on the analysis, this survey suggest research directions for policy and information management studies pointing to best practices regarding core data model implementations and their role in linking isolated data silos within a cross-country context. Finally we highlight the differences in their coordination and maintenance, depending on the state of creation and use. © 2016 ACM.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","327-337","","","01-03-March-2016","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery acmhelp@acm.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ACM Int.

In this paper we propose an approach to the development of a technological platform for KM that integrates semantic Web technologies. This platform supports all processes required in knowledge management. Therefore, the platform enables the automatic identification of patterns and generation of the taxonomies from unstructured texts (documents). The platform consists of tools that allow storing documents (from a knowledge contributor interface), processing of source documents, i.e. identifying sentences, stop-words, identifying n-grams, and generating bags of words, denoting lexical patterns, taxonomic-relation extraction, and inference algorithms to retrieve knowledge from a set of repositories. These algorithms use the previous phases to retrieve knowledge more accurately derived from the semi-structured or structured information previously generated. © 2015 IEEE.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","168-172","","","2016-February","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This is proved on the manners and areas that life was computerized such as in trade, government services, medicine, education, learning etc.Nevertheless, the fast development of designing information systems has created several sub-systems in multiple contexts which are conceived by different communities and totally dispersed geographically but all undertaking the same area. Neither contents nor services that these subsystems are made are certainly in the same technology environments. In our research, the learning field goes through many key steps. Actually, new revolutionized practices were implemented due to technology innovation, so transition from classical learning towards distance learning or d-learning is more than possible, it’s desired. Consequently, this phenomenon has created more opportunities for learners and teachers but also several challenges; in many cases, the multitude of standards hinders the learner migration from a learning environment to another, so it hampers its learning development.In this paper, we will propose a framework of interoperability based on three levels. Since we are interested in semantic level, we propose a process of interoperability of learning content in the cloud era based on a global ontology. Like recommendation systems, we will start our process by acquisition, then validation and finally structuration of the learning content. This structuration way will give to both actors of learning environment a certain flexibility and access to other resources in Cloud environment. The basic principle is to collect content, to enrich it and to make it interoperable by using unified approach in star based on a comprehensive ontology.

The ever increasing amount of linked data in government open data, social linked data, linked medical and patients' data provides new opportunities for data mining and machine learning. Both are however strongly de-pendent on the selection of high quality data features to achieve good results. In this work we present an approach that uses ontological knowledge to generate features that are suitable for building a decision tree classifier addressing the specific data set and classification problem. The approach that we present has two main characteristics - it generates new features on demand as required by the induction algorithm and uses ontological knowledge about linked data to re-strict the set of possible options. These two characteristics enable the induction algorithm to look for features that might be connected through many entities in the linked data enabling the generation of cross-domain explanation models.","2016","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","90-98","","","1733","","","","","","","","CEUR-WS","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Semantic Web; Ontology; Data mining; Data handling; Cross-domain; Artificial intelligence; Linked datum; Decision trees; Open datum; Different domains; Medical computing; Classification (of information); Trees (mathematics); Decision tree classifiers; Feature generation; High quality data; Induction algorithms; Learning systems; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","Mizoguchi, R.; Cudre-Mauroux, P.; Noy, N.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, as the closed-worlds of ES are opened to Internet scale data sources, there is an emerging need to better understand the semantics of such data and how they can be integrated. Foundational ontologies can help establish this understanding and therefore, there is a need to investigate how such ontologies can be applied to underpin practical ES integration solutions. This paper describes research undertaken to assess the effectiveness of such an approach through the development and application of the 4D-Semantic Extract Transform Load (4D-SETL) framework. 4D-SETL was employed to integrate a number of large scale datasets and to persist the resultant ontology within a prototype warehouse based on a graph database. The advantages of the approach included the ability to combine foundational, domain and instance level ontological objects within a single coherent system. Furthermore, the approach provided a clear means of establishing and maintaining the identity of domain objects as their constituent spatiotemporal parts unfolded over time, enabling process and static data to be combined within a single model. © © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

They are at the interface between human and natural systems. From this perspective, natural hazards are a multidimensional domain including environmental issues, the private and public sector and citizens and governance ranging from local to supranational. The vast amount of information and data necessary for comprehensive hazard and risk assessment present many challenges regarding the lack of accessibility, comparability, quality, organisation and dissemination of natural hazards spatial data. In order to mitigate these limitations, an interoperability framework has been developed and published in the INSPIRE Data Specification on Natural Risk Zones—technical guidelines (DS) document. This framework provides means for facilitating access, integration, harmonisation and dissemination of natural hazard data from different domains and sources. The objective of this paper is twofold. Firstly, the paper highlights the key aspects of the interoperability to the various natural hazard communities and illustrates the applicability of the interoperability framework developed in the DS. And secondly, the paper “translates” into common language the main features and potentiality of the interoperability framework of the DS for a wider audience of scientists and practitioners in the natural hazard domain. In this paper, the four pillars of the interoperability framework will be presented. First, the adoption of a common terminology for the natural hazard domain will be addressed. A common data model to facilitate cross-domain data integration will then follow. Thirdly, the common methodology developed to express qualitative or quantitative assessments of natural hazards is presented. Fourthly, the extensible classification schema for natural hazards developed from a literature review and key reference documents from the contributing community of practice is discussed. Furthermore, the applicability of the interoperability framework for the various stakeholder groups is illustrated. This paper closes discussing main advantages, limitations and next steps regarding the sustainability and evolution of the interoperability framework. © 2015, The Author(s).","2015","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","1545-1563","","3","78","","Nat.

Due to rapidly development of open data, e.g. geographic, track, dynamic geospatial data, governments are required to release more and more data for academics and industry. The ubiquitous data are in various types and formats, e.g. number, graphic or specific format provided by different data sources, in distributed environment. All makes it difficult to integrate data to different domain. This paper proposes a data-flow integration mechanism with a unified description for distributed and heterogonous open data. Our approach starts with using Semantic Web technology and web ontology language (OWL), to define a data flow-oriented semantic description model. This supports a domain view description which is a user's aspect of domain. In this model, users are able to describe a domain view via three main components: 1) data unit, 2) link unit, and 3) domain unit.

We present a smart urban fault reporting web platform to help citizens in reporting common urban problems, such as street faults, potholes or broken street lights, and to support the local public administration in responding and fixing those problems quickly. The tool is based on a semantic data model designed for the city, which integrates several distinct data sources, opportunely re-engineered to meet the principles of the Semantic Web and linked open data. The platform supports the whole process of road maintenance, from the fault reporting to the management of maintenance activities. The integration of multiple data sources enables increasing interoperability and heterogeneous information retrieval, thus favoring the development of effective smart urban fault reporting services. Our platform was evaluated in a real case study: a complete urban reporting and road maintenance system has been developed for the municipality of Catania. Our approach is completely generalizable and can be adopted by and customized for other cities.

Bringing together different environmental datasets to confidently enable integrated analysis requires reference to common standards and definitions, which are frequently lacking in environmental data, due to the broad subject area and lack of metadata. Automatic inclusion within datasets of controlled vocabulary concepts from publicly available standard vocabularies facilitates accurate annotation and promotes efficiency of metadata creation. To this end, we have developed a thesaurus capable of describing environmental chemistry datasets. We demonstrate a novel method for tagging datasets, via insertion of this thesaurus into a Laboratory Information Management System, enabling automated tagging of data, thus promoting semantic interoperability between tagged data resources. Being web available, and formatted using the Simple Knowledge Organisation System (SKOS) semantic standard, this thesaurus is capable of providing links both to and from other relevant thesauri, thus facilitating a linked data approach. Future developments will see extension of the thesaurus by the user community, in terms of both concepts included and links to externally hosted vocabularies. By employing a Linked Open Data approach, we anticipate that Web-based tools will be able to use concepts from the thesaurus to discover and link data to other information sources, including use in national assessment of the extent and condition of environmental resources. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2015","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","103-110","","1","8","","Earth Sci.

The situation can be aptly described by John Naisbitt's quote, 'We are drowning in information but starved for knowledge'. The information overload in intelligent systems has highlighted the restricted ability of knowledge representation (KR) formalisms to cope with various forms of uncertainty in knowledge. Probabilistic extensions of KR formalisms are the most investigated for uncertainty representation. Probabilistic extensions of formal logics offer expressiveness at the cost of tractability of reasoning. On the other hand Probabilistic extensions of graphical models makes simplifying assumptions to achieve better computational performance but are less expressive. In fact one of the most noted problem of probabilistic KR formalisms is the difficulty to achieve the expressiveness-of-representation vs tractability-of-reasoning trade off. In addition the KR formalism for open domains such as Semantic Web need to facilitate information sharing and semantic interoperability as well. Ontologies have already been successfully used as KR formalism as they facilitates semantic interoperability and therefore automated reasoning; one of the essentials to cope with information overload. However traditional ontologies cannot deal with uncertain knowledge. Probabilistic ontologies use probabilistic KR formalisms and therefore can cope up with domain uncertainty. This paper investigates the applicability of probabilistic ontology as a KR formalism for a Semantic Web use case. Previous work on probabilistic ontologies has investigated use cases such as fraud detection, threat detection, and breast cancer detection in government, military and healthcare domains but not in Semantic Web. Uncertainty also manifests in various forms and all of them are often not present in single use case. We have chosen the use case for achieving belief fusion under uncertainty to investigate how probabilistic ontology copes with all three expectations for a semantic web KR formalism; expressiveness, tractability and semantic interoperability. Proposed probabilistic ontology based system automates the background verification part of human recruiting process. This use case is a representative case for belief fusion and asserts Bayesian networks as belief fusion operator. © 2014 IEEE.","2015","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

Data are deemed a powerful and useful raw material that can impact multidisciplinary research endeavors as well as government, industry, and business performance. Everyone is talking about big data, and it is believed that science, business, industry, government, society, and so forth will undergo a thorough change with the influence of big data [1]. In fact, we now live in the era of big data as huge and complex data sets, which are being produced and collected for diverse purposes through all kinds of technologies or approaches including mobile devices, remote sensing technologies, software logs, wireless sensor networks, and social media. The big data sets tend to be more unstructured, distributed, and complex than ever before [2]. Thus, big data are defined as huge amount of data that require new technologies and architectures so that it becomes possible to extract value from them by capturing and analysis process. Due to such large size of data, it becomes very difficult to perform effective analysis using the existing traditional techniques. Big data due to their various properties like volume, velocity, variety, variability, value, and complexity put forward many challenges [3]. Under the great increase in global data, the term big data is constantly used to describe huge data sets. Compared with traditional data sets, big data typically compose of masses of unstructured data, sensor data, and stream data that need more real-time processing. Big data are characterized by three aspects: (1) data are numerous, (2) data cannot be categorized into regular relational databases, and (3) data are generated, captured, and processed rapidly. Moreover, big data are transforming health care, transportation, aerospace, science, engineering, finance, business, and eventually, the society [4]. In addition, big data also give rise to new opportunities for discovering new values, make us gain an in-depth understanding of the hidden values, and also bring new challenges, for example, how to effectively specify, model, capture, transfer, organize, and manage such data sets [5]. Big data aim to handle high-volume, high-velocity, high-variety data to extract intended data value and ensure high veracity of original data and obtained information that demand cost-effective, innovative forms of data and information processing for enhanced insight, decision making, and process control; all of these demand new data models and new infrastructure services and tools that allow also obtaining from a variety of sources and delivering data in a variety of forms to different data and information consumers and devices [6]. © 2016 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2015","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","139-168","","","","","","","","","","","CRC Press","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Cyber-Physical Systems: From Theory to Practice","","","","LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the existing information is not shared among the organizations that hold it, the alternative is to develop the necessary capabilities to acquire, store, process and manage it, which will lead to duplicated costs, especially unwanted if governmental organizations are concerned. The European Commission has elected IS among public administrations as a priority, has launched several IS initiatives, such as the EUCISE2020 project within the roadmap for developing the maritime Common Information Sharing Environment (CISE), and has defined the levels of interoperability essential for IS, which entail Semantic Interoperability (SI). An open question is how can IS performance be managed? Specifically, how can IS as-is, and to-be states and targets be defined, and how can organizations progress be monitored and controlled? In this paper, we propose 11 indicators for assessing SI that contribute to answering these questions. They have been demonstrated and evaluated with the data collected through a questionnaire, based on the CISE information model proposed during the CoopP project, which was answered by five public authorities that require maritime surveillance information and are committed to share information with each other. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

An efficient land administration system is supposed to orchestrate these registries for crossborder and cross-sector land administration services. The recent developments in Semantic Web technologies and the Linked Data approach provide an efficient and flexible solution for web based integration of datasets recorded in these registries. The mentioned registries were specified according to different data models and standards which lead to interoperability problems. The concerned public organisations therefore need a common data model that clearly identifies the recording units of these registries and their core attributes, as well as relationships between them. The present research responds to this requirement by developing a common vocabulary, a Core Immovable Property Vocabulary, as an extension to the e-Government Core Vocabularies (version 1.0) issued recently by the European Commission (EC). The Core Immovable Property Vocabulary is developed by simplifying and capturing the minimal characteristics of complex domain standards and data specifications, thereby enabling a plain representation of immovable property units and their core attributes that are needed for land administration processes. It thus allows for the publication of land administration data sets within the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and renders the integration of land administration datasets with other registries such as address and civil registries encoded according to the e- Government Core Vocabularies. The vocabulary is the result of an individual research effort, carried out by the authors of the present article, and has recently been hosted by the EC ISA (Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administration) Joinup platform as a semantic asset (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/cipv/description).

Special emphasis of data and language heterogeneity specifically is given to the integration of community data within the higher infrastructure levels. The existing 34 data themes needed for environmental applications are referenced in Annexes I, II and III of the INSPIRE directive. The framework for the implementation is given by key components specified through technical implementing rules. The rules enable sharing of environmental spatial information among public sector organizations and better facilitate public access to spatial information across the European Union. For selected municipal data themes, the relation with the implementing rules will be investigated. The considerations are guided by the objectives of searchability, usability, reusability, composability and interoperability of digital data. Based on the current situation in the context of geographic information, data transformation and the usage of standards of the semantic web and ontologies to solve heterogeneity problems in data management are discussed. Cases of interoperability at the semantic, syntactic, and organisational level as well as results of data transformation and cartographic enhancement of local government data within the European spatial data infrastructure will be illustrated in the paper. In that way, we demonstrate how extensive knowledge which is already available for local government data can be used at the European level. © SGEM2014.","2014","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","559-566","","2","3","","","","","","","","International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference sgem@sgem.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Int.

In this paper, a system for data ingestion and reconciliation of smart cities related aspects as road graph, services available on the roads, traffic sensors etc., is proposed. The system allows managing a big volume of data coming from a variety of sources considering both static and dynamic data. These data are mapped to smart-city ontology and stored into an RDF-Store where they are available for applications via SPARQL queries to provide new services to the users. The paper presents the process adopted to produce the ontology and the knowledge base and the mechanisms adopted for the verification, reconciliation and validation. Some examples about the possible usage of the coherent knowledge base produced are also offered and are accessible from the RDF-Store and related services.

Thus, for modelling semantically the public services, we have adopted semantic web services (SWS) technology. However, this technology allows only semantic description of services without giving a cognitive semantic representation of them. It allows modelling the relationships between services with their different situations through conceptual structures (CSs). In this paper, we develop an approach for modelling efficiently the public services based on SWS and CSs technologies. For this purpose, we extend OWL-S ontology with an e-government knowledge represented through a set of ontologies. Besides OWL-S ontology, we use the conceptual graphs theory as implemented in AminePlatform for structuring and organising the cognitive knowledge about services. Thus, for our application domain, that is, 'e-customs', we extend this platform to support simultaneous use of multiple domain-specific ontologies. Our approach enables as well enhancing service discovery and composition.

The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development is helping the European Union to prepare for an integrative system for intelligent management of biodiversity knowledge. The infrastructure that is envisaged and that will be further developed within the Programme ""Horizon 2020"" aims to provide open and free access to taxonomic information to anyone with a requirement for biodiversity data, without the need for individual consent of other persons or institutions. Open and free access to information will foster the re-use and improve the quality of data, will accelerate research, and will promote new types of research. Progress towards the goal of free and open access to content is hampered by numerous technical, economic, sociological, legal, and other factors. The present article addresses barriers to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge that arise from European laws, in particular European legislation on copyright and database protection rights. We present a legal point of view as to what will be needed to bring distributed information together and facilitate its re-use by data mining, integration into semantic knowledge systems, and similar techniques. We address exceptions and limitations of copyright or database protection within Europe, and we point to the importance of data use agreements. We illustrate how exceptions and limitations have been transformed into national legislations within some European states to create inconsistencies that impede access to biodiversity information. Conclusions. The legal situation within the EU is unsatisfactory because there are inconsistencies among states that hamper the deployment of an open biodiversity knowledge management system. Scientists within the EU who work with copyright protected works or with protected databases have to be aware of regulations that vary from country to country. This is a major stumbling block to international collaboration and is an impediment to the open exchange of biodiversity knowledge. Such differences should be removed by unifying exceptions and limitations for research purposes in a binding, Europe-wide regulation. © Willi Egloff et al.","2014","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","109-135","","414","","","ZooKeys","","","","","","Pensoft Publishers info@pensoft.net Geo Milev Street 13a Sofia 1111","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Biodiversity knowledge; Data use agreement; European copyright; European database protection right; Intellectual property rights; Open Access to data and information; Taxonomy; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, few of the potential service integration applications have been adopted by governments to increase the accessibility of and satisfaction with government services and information for citizens. Recently, the 'life event' concept was introduced as the core element of integrating complexity of service delivery to improve the efficiency and reusability of e-government services, web-based information management systems. In addition, a semantic web-based ontology is considered to be the most powerful conceptual approach for dealing with challenges associated with developing seamless systems in distributed environments. Among these challenges are interoperability, which can be loosely defined as the technical capability for interoperation. Despite the conceptual emergence of semantic web-based ontology for life events, the question remains of what methodology to use when designing a semantic web-based ontology for life events. This paper proposes a semantic web-based ontology model for life events for e-government service integration created using a methodology that implements the model using the ontology modelling tool Protégé and evaluates the model using Pellet Reasoner and the SPARQL query language. In addition, this model is illustrated by two examples, the Saudi Arabia King Abdullah Scholarship and Hafiz, to show the advantages of integrated systems compared with standalone systems. These examples show that the new model can effectively support the integration of standalone e-government services automatically so that citizens do not need to manually execute individual services. This can significantly improve the accessibility of e-government services and citizen's satisfaction. © 2014-IOS Press.","2014","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","189-205","","3","8","","Intelligent Decis.

The method emphasizes the use of natural language descriptions of concepts next to formal descriptions, and uses - for the formal definitions - a fact-oriented formalism grounded in natural language. In this experiment, a group of 36 participants were divided into different groups to build ontologies to establish semantic interoperability between autonomously developed research information systems and to annotate the data of an existing system provided by a public administration. User satisfaction of the tool was measured with the Post-Study System Usability uestionnaire. The result of that survey was that the participants were generally pleased with the platform, with its usefulness scoring best. As for the developed ontologies, their use was demonstrated by the applications developed by the participants. The experiment showed that having a formalism grounded in natural language leverages the ontology construction process for the stakeholders. The experiment also shows that a method needs to take into account the collaborative building of workflows within ontology projects, as not all ontology-engineering projects are alike. © 2014 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","2014","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","48-63","","2","9","","J.

In this context, semantic technologies play a fundamental role in numerous e-government programs. Indeed, these technologies enable enriching the public service description provided by different public administrations with additional semantic information, which allows automatic services processing and information exchange between involved members in comprehensive and interpretable manner, thus facilitating service integration and cooperation. The most frequently used technologies in this area are semantic web services (SWS) technology and ontology. Thus, for modelling efficiently public services, the authors have exploring, studying and analyzing some of e-government researches and projects that applied semantic technologies. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors address how semantic technologies transform the e-government domain through exploring and studying the use of SWS and ontology in numerous researches and projects applying these technologies in this area. Then, the authors have compared them through a set of criteria defined according to e-government requirements such as the SWS modelling approach for describing semantically public services, ontologies for representing governmental specific features (e.g. regulation and organizational structures) and developed portal for supporting user's perspectives. Based on this study, the authors have identified the appropriate standards, frameworks, and models for developing the framework. Findings: The authors have developed a framework for public services which enhances existing approaches with additional aspects. Thus, the approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of services. This semantic is developed in form of a Sit/Ctx ontology developed based on CSs model represented through conceptual graphs theory. The authors have used this model besides OWL-S, improving thus the level of automation of discovery and composition process of public services, which become more efficient with taken into consideration their interrelations and situations. Originality/value: The approach comparing to other works improves the service ontology with a cognitive semantic approach to support the multiple usage contexts and situations of public services, providing thus the end-users (people and enterprises) a better orientation in discovery process. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","2014","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","49-75","","1","8","","Trans.

Despite real-time availability of 'big data' from ubiquitous sensors, mobile devices, 3D printing of drugs, and a mind shift in data ownership, data integration still remains one of the core challenges to innovation. Increasingly persistent, semantic data integration is gaining recognition for its dynamic data model and formalisms which make it possible to infer from and reason over interconnected contextualized data, creating actionable knowledge faster and at lower cost. While such technical advances underpin the successful strategies to drive positive patient outcomes or accelerate drug design, there are equally profound social changes towards the willingness of patients to share their own data - opening doors to new patient-centric, precision-medicine healthcare models. Adding astronomically rising costs in research and healthcare, we have arrived at a critical turning point where it is now well within our reach to change how drugs are developed, how trials are performed and how patients are treated - and we can do this with huge benefits for otherwise unsustainable industries. Examples show that not only is this possible today, but that such approaches already have traction; (i) in Pharma for assessing impact of excipient on drug stability and efficacy; for pre-clinical toxicity assessment and integral systems views on drug safety, (ii) in Government at the FDA's cross species biomarker initiative to reduce animal testing and (iii) in Health Care for organ transplant rejection assessment and COPD. Using comparative effectiveness and side effect analyses to base treatments on solid prognoses and therapy decision support, we can and must change discovery and healthcare into a data driven and patient centric paradigm. The socio-economic benefits of such a change will be enormous. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.","2013","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","1-22","","","7970 LNBI","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

We aim to describe the semantic layer that was designed in the scope of the SPOCS project to enable the validation of documents in the scope of cross border procedures. The SPOCS project (Simple Procedures Online for Cross- Border Services)1 focuses in particular on the transfer of documents to European administrations in the scope of procedures to deliver services across borders. One of the problems that arise is the heterogeneity of documents between countries even they have the same role. With the increase of cross border activities encouraged by the service directive in particular, electronic procedures are more important than ever. The project has therefore set up an infrastructure including the transfer of documents in a metadata container and the validation of documents. Cross-border service pilots have been implemented to show the added value of the SPOCS infrastructure. To overcome the problem of semantic equivalence of documents, the European Commission has encouraged the implementation of a semantic layer to support the interoperability between administrative systems and the reuse of resources across government bodies. In the scope of the SPOCS project, we have implemented a set of pilots to illustrate the added value of implementing a semantic interoperability layer and developing common models and vocabularies. Common ontologies have been designed to describe documents, equivalences, and procedures. Specific access mechanisms have been implemented to automatically verify the status of European companies. Finally, semantic rules have been created to determine the procedure that needs to be used in order to provide a cross border service.

In addition, malware have become a growing important problem for governments and commercial organizations. The key point of the research on the network security is to judge and validate the similarity metrics among the malicious software. Indeed, most computer network issues are also caused by malware. As a consequence, one enhanced system to analyze the behavior of malwares is needed to try to predict the malicious actions and to minimize the computer damages caused by the malware. However, the conventional data analysis tools lack the ability to deal with the computer safety because the environments malwares operating are with high levels of imprecision and vagueness. For this reason, we have developed Taiwan Malware Analysis Net (TWMAN) to improve the accuracy of malware behavioral analysis. This chapter tries to explorer and deal with these computer security and safety issues by integrating the semantic technologies and computational intelligence methods, such as the fuzzy ontologies and fuzzy markup language (FML). With the proposed approach, the malware identification has achieved a good performance according to the experimental results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2013","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","113-132","","","296","","Stud.

However, this new business paradigm for the provision of computing infrastructure has certain obstacles, including provider lock-in. When a client chooses a specific Cloud service provider, he also gets the provider's specific protocols, standards and tools, making a potential future migration complex and costly. Cloud Computing is still immature, with no firmly established standards governing all the aspects of its utilization. The migration issue can be overcome by using interoperable Cloud services. In this paper we focus on the platform as a service (PaaS) model of Cloud Computing. This model provides a complete computing platform needed to run applications over the Internet. Every PaaS provider (such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Salesforce) has specified its custom application programming interfaces (APIs). However, to achieve interoperability we need to develop a standardized set of APIs that constitute an interoperability platform. In this paper, we firstly present the key concepts and relevant related work from the existing literature. Thereafter we propose a novel PaaS API ontology to share a common understanding of the main concepts from providers' APIs. We used a prominent ontology development methodology to determine the domain and scope of our ontology, review similar existing ontologies, define the relevant classes and their hierarchy as well as to define the properties of classes and create their instances. The concepts in our ontology were derived from PaaS resources, remote Cloud functions specified in the API documentation of the most important PaaS solutions, existing Cloud ontologies, Cloud Computing models andstandards for Semantic Web services. The aim of the proposed ontology is the description of PaaS resourcesand their operations. It was built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and the Protege tool. In the future, we plan to use this ontology to semantically annotate PaaS API operations and create a mechanism to determineand solve interoperability problems among two or more PaaS services provided by different vendors.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","47-54","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

Lack of agreement and guidance on the meaning and format of information to be exchanged between Member States are the main stumbling block. Semantic interoperability is jeopardized by different interpretations of the information exchanged between people and applications, thus hampering the effective and efficient creation of new European public services. In an attempt to promote the use of common models and standards, governments develop e-Government metadata repositories to store semantic data models, taxonomies, codelists and reference data making them openly available for reuse. The term semantic asset has been devised to refer to these types of resources. However, these repositories differ in their scope, target group, implementation technologies and end-user interfaces. Although, the semantic content they include can often be reused, their physical isolation and the heterogeneity of the assets hamper the reusability of common concepts and cross-repository search. To deal with these challenges, this paper specifies a generic Exchange API that capitalizes on Linked Data technologies and REST in order to enable the semantic integration of distributed metadata repositories, thus creating a flexible federation which facilitates cross-repository querying and consequently enhances semantic asset reusability.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","905","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Interoperability; Metadata; Government data processing; Electronic data interchange; Linked data; Reusability; Linked datum; e-Government; E-Government; ADMS; Federation of semantic asset repositories; Rest; Semantic assets; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Allscripts EMR is being used at ante/prenatal clinics to document ante/prenatal care and General Electricity's Centricity Perinatal (CPN) is being used at labor and delivery units in the hospital. Both applications differ in their content usage, software/hardware architectures, and platforms. Clinical information from these prenatal clinics/hospitals is transmitted after every visit to the RHIO, which acts as a clinical data repository and an aggregator of clinical information.

The resulting experimental datasets are increasingly being disseminated via publically accessible repositories. However, existing repositories lack sufficient metadata to describe the experiments and are often difficult to navigate by non-experts. The lack of standardized descriptions and semantics of biological assays and screening results hinder targeted data retrieval, integration, aggregation, and analyses across different HTS datasets, for example to infer mechanisms of action of small molecule perturbagens. To address these limitations, we created the BioAssay Ontology (BAO). BAO has been developed with a focus on data integration and analysis enabling the classification of assays and screening results by concepts that relate to format, assay design, technology, target, and endpoint. Previously, we reported on the higher-level design of BAO and on the semantic querying capabilities offered by the ontology-indexed triple store of HTS data. Here, we report on our detailed design, annotation pipeline, substantially enlarged annotation knowledgebase, and analysis results. We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository, PubChem, and demonstrate its utility to categorize and analyze diverse HTS results from numerous experiments. BAO is publically available from the NCBO BioPortal at http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/1533. BAO provides controlled terminology and uniform scope to report probe and drug discovery screening assays and results. BAO leverages description logic to formalize the domain knowledge and facilitate the semantic integration with diverse other resources. As a consequence, BAO offers the potential to infer new knowledge from a corpus of assay results, for example molecular mechanisms of action of perturbagens. © 2012 Vempati et al.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","11","7","","PLoS ONE","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","standardization; Databases, Factual; information system; semantics; article; knowledge base; Internet; information processing; Computational Biology; bioassay ontology; data analysis; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; drug research; drug targeting; high throughput screening; High-Throughput Screening Assays; technology; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the early days of the Semantic Web (1999-2006), research efforts of the community were centered around knowledge representation; thus, most of the research work was focused on building ontologies (ontology engineering), developing formal languages to represent them (ontology language), methodologies to evaluate and evolve ontologies (ontology evaluation and evolution (OE)), and logic for reasoning with them. As a result of this, even though ontologies were being developed but their instantiation was inadequate to provide the actual instance data needed for the evaluation and analysis of the developed ontologies. In order to overcome this issue, test data was often used to perform the above tasks [1]. However, in the recent past, the focus has shifted towards publishing data either with little or no use of ontologies [2]. This shift in focus is credited to the Linked Open Data (LOD) Project which has published billions of assertions on the Web using well known Linked Data principles. Because of this, the research focus has shifted from knowledge-centered to data-centered and is now settling down at the point where domain ontologies are being used to publish real-world data on the Web. This trend promotes consistent and coherent semantic interoperability between users, systems and applications. In this regard, several domain ontologies have been developed to describe the information pertaining to different domains such as Healthcare and Life Science (HCLS), governments, social spaces, libraries, entertainment, financial service and eCommerce. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","813-817","","","7295 LNCS","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Those information systems usually take the form of workflow systems. Due to the large social impact of e-government systems, computer security plays a pivotal role in ensuring its efficiency and effectiveness. Access control is one of the key aspects of computer security. Current access control models do not take into account the context of the system and its environment. In this article, we argue that a formal context-sensitive access control model can improve the development of e-government workflow systems and present a particular context-sensitive access control model. The subject of the article is a specification of the context-sensitive access control model for business processes (COBAC). By using a context-sensitive access control, it is possible to define more sophisticated access control policies that cannot be implemented by existing access control models. The COBAC's context is modeled using Web Ontology Language (OWL) in order to provide formal representation of context, rich representation of diverse contextual information, semantic interoperability between various context-aware systems, and a high degree of inference making. The presented model is applicable in different e-government systems, and supports the definition of access control policies for both simple and complex business processes. The model's prototype is verified by a case study on a real e-government business process-the national petty offense trial proceedings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","184-213","","2","22","","J.

Exploiting the network-enabled information flows turns out to be the only effective way to meet the challenges and threats we face in this modern, interconnected world. Enhanced inter-agency and inter-company communication and collaboration has been defined as the capability to deliver information superiority whenever required to enable agile and informed decision making to underpin effects-based operations: delivering the right effect, at the right time, to achieve the outcome required. Challenges and threats in our modern world are global and multi-faceted requiring complex responses: governments and corporations buoyed by the realization that the interests of both are mutually engage, are pursuing joint corporate social responsibility to make life and business conduct safe and sustainable. One outcome is increasing openness: organizations increasingly publish data and knowledge in open formats and open spaces and (others) provide tools to gain insight from this open and openly accessible data. Network enablement increases inclusion and participation of people in all domains of private and public life; internet-enabled social networking contributes to data available for analysis and better understanding of human factors.

Semantic assets and the agreements associated with them are essential elements for organisations to understand the meaning of the information they exchange - without them this information would be of little use. In this paper, semantic assets are defined as ontologies, data models, data dictionaries, code lists, XML and RDF schemas which are used for information exchange and that can be reused by implementers of Information Systems, in particular, as part of machine-to-machine interfaces. However, field research has shown that developers, practitioners and researchers working in the field of semantic interoperability in eGovernment tend to reinvent the wheel and semantic assets are rarely reused. In order to encourage and bootstrap the reuse of semantic assets in the EU and beyond, this paper introduces two important initiatives driven by the ISA Programme: the Asset Description Metadata Schema (ADMS) and the ADMS-enabled federation of semantic asset repositories on Joinup.

Semantic Web based solutions for E-Governance provide real time intelligence by making the machine understand the information and takes intelligent decision by integrating heterogeneous data from distributed sources in more autonomous way. In existing E-Governance, duplicate information spread throughout different department datasets. Failing to maintain consistent information across the datasets of departments leads to incorrect and unreliable result to the user query. The e-services themselves are not interoperable, hence it makes difficult for the citizen to access the services and it is not possible to refine a new service. This paper aims at the design of semantic web based Indian E-Governance system for connecting the distributed heterogeneous data of various e-services. The proposed method creates a unique access point for the services so that they can be easily accessed and interconnected. In order to maintain consistent citizen information, common citizen ontology is built and shared among the e-services of certain government departments. The proposed system uses the unique-id for the citizen to enable easy integration of distributed data of various services and greater service delivery. This method also effectively increases the efficiency of data management. The proposed system allows the user to select any service using dedicated URI and make a query from anywhere at any time. After the semantic translation, the user query is sent to the semantic server. The agent with the help of knowledge base automatically finds and integrates the relevant information from various services and gives the correct decision to the user. Thus, semantically enabled e-governance framework provides intelligent inference for the user query and efficient accessibility of all services. The proposed system makes the maintenance easier as it allows for the information reuse, interoperability, sharing and automatic discovery of new services. © EuroJournals Publishing, Inc. 2012.","2012","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","26-36","","1","85","","Eur.

We used BAO to annotate assays from the largest public HTS data repository. PubChem. Here we demonstrate how BAO can be applied to access and analyze HTS data.

Mostly, different aspects of semantic interoperability have been addressed, which distinguished these artefacts from each other. But on the other hand, all these artefacts have one characteristic in common: they are big, complex,complicated, not easy to understand for people who are not familiar with the concepts and technology of the Semantic Web, and (sometimes) not easy to integrate into legacy systems. But this is crucial in the context of public administration, because there are small- and medium-sized public authorities, e.g., municipalities with limited resources, as well as big and advanced public authorities with a sufficient amount of resources, but existing information systems that cannot be replaced easily, e.g., because they are customized to local needs. In this work in progress paper the question is posed, how the technology regarding the facilitation of semantic interoperability can be simplified, so that these concepts and technology are first of all more understandable to employees and second easier to implement in small- and medium-sized public authorities like municipalities. A deliberation on this question promises the possibility, that the barriers for using these concepts and technology in municipality can be reduced and, that the municipalities can take advantage of these concepts and technology. Some ideas how this question can be approached are outlined in this poster paper.","2011","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","657-657","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

This raises the engineering issues of integration, reusability, maintenance and interoperability of autonomous eGovernment systems of government departments and agencies. Therefore, appropriate methodologies which consistently address the aforementioned engineering issues throughout eGovernment development phases are needed. This study presents a methodology framework which amalgamates features from maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains for a unified and agile semantic-driven development of eGovernment systems. Firstly, the methods and techniques currently used for the planning, design, and implementation of eGovernment systems worldwide are investigated; a critical analysis is carried out to identify their advantages and disadvantages, as well as their contribution towards addressing the aforementioned engineering issues. Secondly, the proposed methodology framework is drawn and described. Finally, a flowchart is used to specify the iterative and incremental business process model of the proposed methodology framework. The aims of the study are twofold: (1), providing direction for the semantic-driven development of future eGovernment systems which would facilitate their integration and interoperability towards onestop eGovernment, and (2), unifying the currently used methods and techniques for efficient planning and implementation of future eGovernment systems based on semantic technologies. The main contribution of the study is the investigation and amalgamation of features from the maturity models, traditional software engineering and semantic knowledge representation research domains to enable the planning and agile semantic-driven implementation of future eGovernment systems.

Geospatial data, which give location information for geographic features, are pervasive across many disciplines and fundamental for diverse applications, such as economic development, natural resources, environmental protection, and emergency response. But, re-using geospatial data remains difficult because of its heterogeneity. Although progress has been made by initiatives such as the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) and Geospatial One-Stop to distribute data, it is now necessary to address issues of standards harmonization and agreement on the meanings of relevant concepts in diverse data sets due to different community views. The lack of semantic interoperability has been recognized as a stumbling block to collaboration. As a solution, well designed, formal ontologies, relying on agreements between communities on unambiguous representation of concepts and relationships for a given problem area, can be used as an analytic tool to bridge community gaps. The purpose of this INTEROP project is to create opportunities for the geospatial community to work on semantic agreements and use semantic mappings and other emerging Semantic Web technologies. An initial INTEROP Network is based on the existing SOCoP network that has a core group of active participants from academia, government, and industry. We now want to broaden the Network to cover various domains and include more participants. One of the purposes of this paper is to include the ASPRS community and gather additional use cases.","2011","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","526-530","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Am.

Semantic web (SW) technologies and applications can leverage the potential of eGovernment service integration and discovery, thus tackling the problems of semantic heterogeneity characterizing eGovernment information sources and the different levels of interoperability. eGovernment services will therefore be semantically described in the foreseeable future. In an environment with semantically annotated services, software agents are essential as the entities responsible for exploiting the semantic content in order to automate some tasks, and so enhance the user's experience. In this paper, we present a framework that provides a seamless integration of semantic web services and intelligent agents technologies by making use of ontologies to facilitate their interoperation. The proposed framework can assist in the development of powerful and flexible distributed systems in complex, dynamic, heterogeneous, unpredictable and open environments. Our approach is backed up by a proof-of-concept implementation, where the breakthrough of integrating disparate eGovernment services has been tested. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","2011","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","416-436","","5","28","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Expert Syst","","","","Interoperability; Semantic Web; Ontology; Semantic heterogeneity; Web services; Distributed systems; e-Government; Ontologies; E-government services; Proof of concept; Multi agent systems; Multi-agent systems; EGovernment; Intelligent agents; Semantic web services; Service integration; Agents technology; Information sources; Interoperations; Open environment; Seamless integration; Semantic content; Software agents; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Expert Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As different authorities typically use different terms to describe their resources and publish them in various Digital Service Registries that may enhance the access to and delivery of governmental knowledge, but also need to communicate seamlessly at a national and pan-European level, the need for a unified digital public service metadata standard emerges. This paper presents the creation of an ontology-based extended metadata set that embraces services, documents, XML Schemas, code lists, public bodies and information systems.

Interoperability becomes very important for e-Government information systems that support cross-organizational communication especially in a cross-border setting. The main goal in this context is to seamlessly provide integrated services to the user (citizen). In this paper we focus on Pan European e-Services and issues related with their integration. Our analysis uses basic concepts of the generic public service model of the Governance Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and of the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), to express the semantic description of the e-services. Based on the above, we present a mediation infrastructure capable of resolving semantic interoperability conflicts at a pan-European level.

On the other hand, issues like service, data and process integration have been researched by the Semantic Web community for several years now, and in the last two to three years we have witnessed the first applications of semantic technologies in real, operational e-government systems in both Europe and the US which address exactly these challenges. With this book, the editors present the latest research results on how to use semantic technologies in order to improve or even revolutionize the use of ICT in public administration systems. The contributions are organized into three parts: architectures and process integration, ontologies and interoperability, and portals and user interactions. They give a broad overview of how semantic technologies have been applied in different e-government projects funded from the European program for ICT Research and Development, and they cover a wide spectrum of semantic technologies such as development of domain and service ontologies, semantic enhancements of business process models, semantic Service-Oriented Architectures (SOAs) based on Semantic Web Services (SWS) frameworks, and ontology-based knowledge management. In this volume, researchers of Semantic Web technologies will find a wealth of challenging real-world scenarios to stimulate new fields of research, while developers of e-government systems as well as other stakeholders in public administration will appreciate the detailed presentations and discussions of numerous applications in areas such as e-government portals, personalization of Web-based public services, or integration and orchestration of public administration processes. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","2010","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","1","","","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Semantic Technol. for E-Gov.

CSI-Piemonte, as ICT body of the Local Public Administration, manages a great deal of data, both alphanumeric and geographic, which altogether represent a wide set of detailed description of the regional data patrimony. According to the document European Interoperability Framework (EIF), interoperability consists in the ability from part of systems ICT and supported processes to exchange data and to share information and knowledge. In particular EIF identifies three fundamental levels of interoperability to consider: organizational interoperability, semantic interoperability and technical interoperability. In this perspective the so-called semantic interoperability has a fundamental role. The definition of semantic interoperability to the inside of the document is following: ""Semantic Interoperability is concerned with ensuring that the precise meaning of exchanged information is understandable by any other application that was not initially developed for this purpose. Semantic interoperability enables systems to combine received information with other information resources and to process it in a meaningful manner."" According to the perspective of the semantic interoperability, it's not to characterize reusable data formats, but to comprise, to make exploitation, to connect between the various shadings of meant that these assume in the practical one of the administrative procedures, to the aim to render the effective composition and unification of various services possible. The technology key in order to face this problem is today that one of the so-called ontologies, data structures that they describe the meant one of the terms uses you from a computer science application or an organization so that the computers (but also the men) can reason on the relations between such terms, characterizing similarity and differences of meant. Data and service requests are currently generated and managed in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, different actors (e.g., service providers, product sellers, governmental organizations) need to exchange data in a wealth of different formats. To allow an effective information exchange, systems need to support interoperability, thus enabling the sharing of information and knowledge. To this end, a general-purpose exchange data model needs to be defined. The following described experiences propose a conceptual box contaning: - in the lower parts, metadata and data of portal objects - in the upper parts, conceptual data models (""light"" ontologies) Semantics criteria extracts knowledge from lower parts, light ontologies validates knowledge. Upper intelligence increments lower intelligence, and viceversa. This generalized methods allows knowledge reuse, experimented with Central Public Administration vs. Local Public Administration. Any kinds of light ontologies, in coherence with lower level, can infer and reuse knowledge, for example also for other European Public Administration.","2010","2026-01-17 07:02:48","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","614","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Interoperability; Semantics; Public administration; Metadata; Information exchanges; Semantic interoperability; Computer software reusability; Interoperability framework; Technical interoperability; Organizational interoperability; Birds; Management; Administrative procedures; Conceptual data models; Information technology; Science applications; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a conceptual framework of ontology based e-government service integration, using Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah Scholarship Program (SAKASP) as a case study. SAKASP is a multi-domain program in which students must collect information from various Ministries to complete applications and the administering authority must verify the information supplied by the Ministries. The current implementation of SAKASP is clumsy because it is a mixture of online submission and manual collection and verification of information; its time-consuming and tedious procedures are inconvenient for the applicants and inefficient for the administrators. The proposed framework provides an integrated service by employing semantic web service (SWS) and ontology, improving the current implementation of SAKASP by automatically collecting and processing the related information for a given application. The article includes a typical scenario that demonstrates the workflow of the framework. This framework is applicable to other multi-domain e-government services. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.","2010","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","403-411","","","4","","Smart Innov.

There are various urban geographic information system projects that have been produced by local governments all over the world. However, there are technical difficulties, a lack of spatial data standards and specific policies governing geographic information system projects. The result of the current situation is that the process of data collection is sometimes inefficient and the quality of the data may be inadequate. Furthermore, there are problems with managing projects and sharing data. The key to resolving these problems is to develop a harmonised geographic information model for the urban governance of Turkey. The model should fulfill the application-driven geographic data needs of local governments and support decision-making processes at regional and national levels. The domain model is an object-relational model and the starting point for creating sector models. The generic conceptual model components were defined to harmonise geographic data and to produce data specifications. In order to enable semantic interoperability unified modelling language has produced the application schemas for data themes such as administrative unit, address, cadastre/building, hydrographic, topography, geodesy, transportation, and land cover/use. The model has been tested and revised with local applications such as economic and demographic spatial analysis cases.","2010","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","65-76","","2","163","","Proc.

In Europethis process is mainly initiated by the European service directive. Germany actually has started a special project called D115, which shall provide a simple, quick and efficient access to public service information German-wide by using a single phone number 115. One technical problem in the context of D115 is the intelligent and quick routing of incoming calls to the enquiry offices, another is the technical integration and maintenance of the existing public service information repositories and a special semantic problem is the customer-orientated identification, description and the functional exchange of this knowledge between the participating organizations and public service centres. The general goal of this project is building up a virtual network of service centres with one face to the customer like citizens and enterprises, which ensures valid and quick access to information about all available public services in Germany. A crucial prerequisite to reach this goal is the semantic integration of the distributed knowledge about public services that can be found in different locations, organizations and formats mostly formulated in an inconsistent and sometimes misunderstandable manner. Given the multitude and diversity of public authorities, e. g. there are more than 12,000 municipalities in Germany, an intelligent and flexible solution to integrate these different service repositories is needed. During the last years different semantic approaches in general based on ontologies were developed to integrate distributed information about public services. Theses approaches mainly focus on formal and structural aspects of public service descriptions, i.e. which attributes or characteristics should be used to describe a public service. But concepts and solutions for an effective and valid harmonizing of the semantic differences are not available or address thisissueonly partially. In this paper existing approaches for describing public services are examined in regard to the requirements and constraints of public service centres and in the context of the project D115. Furthermore a new approach to define and build of a taxonomy of public services to support the process of providing information in public service centres is proposed. This approach is based on results of a research project of the University of Duisburg-Essen within the context of the D115 initiative in cooperation with the service centres of several municipalities in North Rhine-Westphalia. The project was designed to gather the requirements for a classification system of public services from the perspective of public service centres as well as to verify the feasibility of this approach in the service centre praxis.","2009","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","355-362","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

As a case study, we embedded our solution into a real system, built for the analysis and management of experts' curricula in an e-government environment. We show how it is possible to automatically build OLAP dimensions, inheriting the hierarchic structure of ontologies, with the goal of using the semantically indexed data to carry out multidimensional OLAP analyses.

Towards that direction we propose in this paper the Electricity Market Ontology (ELMO), an ontological model that provides a shared, common understanding of concepts and procedures regarding the electricity market operation.

Interoperability becomes very important for e-Government information systems that support cross-organizational communication especially in a cross-border setting. The main goal in this context is to seamlessly provide integrated services to the user (citizen). In this paper we focus on Pan European e-Services and issues related with their integration. Our analysis uses basic concepts of the generic public service model of the Governance Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and of the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO), to express the semantic description of the e-services. Based on the above, we present a mediation infrastructure capable of resolving semantic interoperability conflicts at a pan-European level.

The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. The authors also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS using Description Logics. The system illustrates an application of domain ontology of urban environmental hydrology and evaluation of decision maker’s consequences of land use changes.

The very core of this framework lies in the use of Semantic Web Services as a means to execute even complex administrative processes in a semi-automatic way, hence the need for added semantic value in the definition of such services. Because each participant is responsible for both authoring its domain knowledge representation and defining the services provided, and these tasks may be performed at different times by different individuals who may or may not belong to the same domain, the problem of heterogeneous individual knowledgeability arises. Also, the set of standards that were adopted in SPCoop includes specifications that have since been replaced by newer versions and show little coverage by existing implementations. SAscha is a Web tool intended to address such issues, offering an essentially simple WYSIWYM approach to annotating Web Service descriptors with SAWSDL references to concepts within domain ontologies which are stored in an ad-hoc repository. SAscha is provided as a Rich Internet Application (RIA) so as to be deployed as an infrastructural service itself for immediate use, without any need to resort to potentially complex client applications.","2008","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","426","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: CEUR Workshop Proc.","","","","Interoperability; Web services; Knowledge representation; Interoperability framework; Domain ontologies; Administrative process; Client applications; Descriptors; Domain knowledge representations; Rich internet application (RIA); Semantic value; Semi-automatics; Service interoperability; Web tools; WYSIWYM; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CEUR Workshop Proceedings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, a variety of data and metadata standards have been put forward: from government departments, from industry groups, and from organisations such as the ISO and W3C. This paper shows how the leading standard for metadata registration - ISO 11179 - can be deployed without the need for a single, monolithic conceptualisation of the domain, and hence without the need for universal agreement upon a particular model of electronic governance.

The case study follows up the application of a requirements-driven approach for designing e-government service interfaces with respect to the informational needs of citizens and business users. Using this approach, a conceptual model for e-government services was developed, formalised in the WSML ontology language, and used for semantic annotation of the services as a basis for integration. A subsequent field test was focused on the evaluation of produced semantic description on the client-side system components as Annotation tool and the Personal Assistant Client.

Many research projects attempting to formulate some modelling strategies as the new technologies and development techniques are being proposed in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) domain. In absence of a documented best common practice of design and modelling techniques for e-service composition, it would be greatly beneficial to discover such common practices and describe the detail specifications of a repeatable methodology for e-service composition projects. This paper will discuss some proposed e-government integration models, and then it will introduce some e-service integration practices and classifications of e-service composition strategies. The main contribution of this paper is to propose detailed specifications of a repeatable methodology for e-service composition projects. This methodology called E-service Integration Methodology (E-SIM) is a repeatable process, clearly defining all the tasks and activities of its process to provide effective management control over all these tasks and activities. This paper also will use E-SIM to model a simplified e-service integration solution as a proof of concept. © 2008 IEEE.","2008","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","459-464","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Proc.

However, the administration and interoperability of distributed e-government nodes are faced with increasing challenges caused by the service-oriented modeling difficulties and ontological issues in distributed computing, resource integration and knowledge sharing over heterogeneous computing platforms. To overcome this, a Semantic Grid infrastructure is presented in this paper for distributed management of e-government resources across ubiquitous virtual governmental agencies. An ontology-based service-oriented approach to problem-solving in e-government is proposed in the Semantic Grid, enabling to provide, in an open, dynamic, loosely coupled and scalable manner, the service publication, discovery and reuse for connecting the customers and agencies of e-government services based on their semantic similarities in terms of problem-solving capabilities. The operation of the system is demonstrated using Protégé-2000, a widely accepted ontology modeling tool to validate the implementation of the proposed approach towards effective ontological maintenance.","2008","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","273-282","","4","3","","WSEAS Trans.

Semantic Web technologies and applications can leverage the potential of eGovernment service integration and discovery, facing the problems of semantic heterogeneity of eGovernment information sources and the different levels of interoperability. In line with this, eGovernment services will be semantically described in the foreseeable future. In an environment with semantically- annotated services, software agents are essential as the entities responsible for exploiting the semantic content in order to automate some tasks thus improving the user experience. In this paper, we first present SEMMAS, an ontology-based Multi-Agent framework for seamlessly integrating Intelligent Agents and Semantic Web Services. The proposed framework is independent from both the application and the domain. Our approach is backed with a proof-of-concept implementation where the breakthrough of integrating disparate eGovernment services has been tested. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","2008","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","15-30","","","5006 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

The e-government effort in many countries has provided a platform for government entities and their business partners to exchange data through Information Communication Technologies (ICT) and standards such as RosettaNet (B2B data exchange standard), EDIFACT (Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and Transport), XML (Extensible Markup Language) and EDI (Electronic Data Interchange). However, e-government efforts have not really resolved data heterogeneity problems significantly due to limitation of these standards. One such limitation is the inability of data inheritance. In order to solve this problem with emphasis on Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Web Services, a semantically enriched web service for the public sector is needed. Thus we propose an ontology-based solution which allows data inheritance and polymorphism. This goal of this paper is to show how heterogeneous e-government documents can be semantically matched. We propose a shared hierarchical knowledge repository approach and a detailed process methodology for semantic mediation. A two-part semantic mediation approach using SRS (Semantic Relatedness Scores) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) is highlighted. Both measures are complimentary and provide the semantics necessary for resolving schema heterogeneity. Our approach incorporates a rule-based engine that reads and executes SWRL rules (i.e. RacerPro). We also adopted several tools for proof-of-concept such as Protege (i.e. ontology editor) and JESS (Java Expert Shell System). © 2008 Universidad de Talca-Chile.","2008","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","52-63","","3","3","","J.

Integrating and extending recent developments in Germany, Hong-Kong, UK and US governments - but also eBusiness interoperability research results in Europe, the proposed approach is applied within the Greek e-Government Framework and bears the following steps: (a) Gathering and analysis of governmental service forms at field level, so that common structures can be identified, (b) Customization of UN/CEFACT Core Components, (c) Semiautomatic XML Schema Definition (XSD) files creation, using sets of naming, structuring and verification rules, (d) Adoption of international or development of country-specific Codelists, (e) Development of guidance material for the application of the approach by government officials at central or local level. Discussion on the results is targeting best practice examples that can be drawn at scientific and organizational level, but also the key difficulties that have to be tackled - in relevance with the administrations and industry readiness in each country.

The paper reviews the feasibility of ontology-based spatial resource integration options to combine the core spatial reasoning with domain-specific application models. We propose an ontology-based framework for semantic level communication of spatial objects and application models. We then introduce a multi-agent system, ontology-based spatial information and resource integration services (OSIRIS), to semantically interoperate complex spatial services and integrate them in a meaningful composition. The advantage of using multi-agent collaboration in OSIRIS is that it obviates the need for end-user analysts to be able to decompose a problem domain to subproblems or to map different models according to what they actually mean. We also illustrate a multi-agent interaction scenario for collaborative modeling of spatial applications using the proposed custom feature of OSIRIS.

The proceedings and conclusions from this meeting are presented in the following report. This paper was prepared with the involvement of leading biomedical researchers, computer scientists, engineers, and Information & Communication Technology (ICT) experts. The purpose of this document is to provide a research roadmap towards ""Net-Centric Healthcare"", 1 all the while reconciling with future USAMRMC priorities. In an effort to produce tools that enable/enhance research, education, and direct patient care under the umbrella of the Department of Defense Tricare System, this report concludes with a call for TATRC (and others) to enable Grid technologies via applied research programs for the Military Healthcare Service (MHS). This document serves to communicate expectations and requirements to all parties - end users, policymakers, scientists, as well as technology leaders. The roadmap provides a foundation upon which TATRC may organize its strategic priorities and commit to resource allocations. HealthGrids are computational environments of shared resources in which heterogeneous and dispersed biomedical data is accessed, mined and computed. Advances in computer science allow biomedical researchers to capitalize on ubiquitous & transparent distributed systems and a broad set of tools for resource sharing (computation, storage, data, replication, security, semantic interoperability, and delivery of software as services). The foremost opportunity of the HealthGrid is the creation of a research climate that transforms the biomedical sector into a functional knowledge society, as the contemporary equivalent of the original Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)2 transformed networks to become today's Internet. To synthesize a roadmap from the expertise of the IRT participants, four break-out groups were convened to delineate milestones and estimate requirements necessary to overcome current implementation barriers. A mix of academic, industry and government subject matter experts addressed both technological and socio-political dynamics. The HealthGrid was catalogued into four discrete functions which interoperate: Computation Grids, Data Grids, Knowledge Grids, and Collaboration Grids. The breakout groups mirrored this taxonomy. Systems Medicine provided a framework for the HealthGrid IRT and resultant research roadmap. Contributors worked off the predicate that 'functions of life are mediated by biological networks, and human disease occurs when one or more of these networks become perturbed by genetic mutations and/or abnormal environmental signals'. Systems Medicine is driving development of new in-vivo and in-vitro measurement technologies, which, collectively, in the next 5-20 years, will lead to medical care that is predictive, preventative, personalized and participatory (P4 medicine).4 Grid technologies provide a powerful technology infrastructure and enabler to attain this goal. Derivatively, the HealthGrid aims to foster innovation in how disease is viewed, diagnosed, treated, and prevented. This decade is witness to major revolutions in our comprehension of the human genome, infectious disease, environmental influences, cancer and aging. The advent of electronic health records in combination with Grid technologies and growing interdisciplinary collaborations present the opportunity to participate in new scientific and medical breakthroughs at an ever-accelerating pace, emblematic of our transformation to a 'knowledge society'. This report attempts to refine the broad landscape of the HealthGrid into scalable and 'digestable' targets of opportunity. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

These projects take place in administrations from different levels and provide solutions that are not driven by a common infrastructure. Main shortcomings due to these phenomena are related to lacks of interoperability and difficulties for locating desired services. As a result, the digital gap may get bigger. To overcome these drawbacks, a semantic approach based on LifeEvents, a concept presented in the paper, is proposed. By means of LifeEvents, an interoperable manner to address needs from the point of view of the citizen is developed. As they are described using OWL, powerful semantic resources are available. A process of analysis in the domain has been conducted and this turns out in a powerful ontology that may support the characterization of Life Events. The goal is to allow not only already defined LifeEvents but also those identified in the future. Even more, once LifeEvents are defined by means of an ontology, they are susceptible of being published under the form of Semantic Web Services. Thus, it is possible to enable enhancements about composition, discovery and organization, as shown in the paper, within the framework of this proposal.

To address this problem, an important industry initiative called ""integrating the healthcare enterprise (IHE)"" specified the ""cross enterprise document sharing (XDS)"" profile. In the IHE XDS, healthcare enterprises that agree to work together form a ""clinical affinity domain"" and store healthcare documents in an ebXML registry/repository architecture to facilitate their sharing. The affinity domains also agree on a common set of policies such as coding lists to be used to annotate clinical documents in the registry/ repository and the common schemes for patient identification. However, since patients expect their records to follow them as theymove from one clinical affinity domain to another, there is a need for affinity domains to be federated to enable information exchange. In this paper, we describe how IHE XDS can be enhanced to support federated clinical affinity domains. We demonstrate that federation of affinity domains are facilitated when ontologies, rather than coding term lists, are used to annotate clinical documents. Furthermore, we describe a patient identification protocol that eliminates the need to keep a master patient index file for the federation. © 2007 IEEE.","2007","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","213-221","","2","11","","IEEE Trans Inf Technol Biomed","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; Semantics; Electronic data interchange; Electronic document exchange; Semantic interoperability; eHealth; article; information retrieval; European Union; data base; organization and management; methodology; Database Management Systems; Hospital data processing; Information Storage and Retrieval; medical record; Medical Records Systems, Computerized; computer interface; User-Computer Interface; Automatic indexing; Clinical affinity domain; Clinical document sharing; Cross enterprise document sharing; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; integrated health care system; Integrating the healthcare enterprise; Patient identification; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using DLDB, we have constructed the Hawkeye knowledge base, in which we have loaded more than 166 million facts from a diverse set of real-world data sources. We use this knowledge base to demonstrate realistic integration queries in egovernment and academic scenarios. In order to support Hawkeye, we extended DLDB with additional reasoning capabilities. At present, the Semantic Web consists of numerous independent ontologies. We demonstrate that OWL can be used to integrate these ontologies and thereby integrate the data sources that commit to them. In terms of performance, we show that the load time of our system is linear on the number of triples loaded. Furthermore, we show that many complex queries have response times under one minute, and that simple queries can be answered in seconds. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.","2007","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","1115-1124","","PART 2","4806 LNCS","","","","","","","","Springer Verlag","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: Lect.

Much of the Joint Network Enabled Operations (NEO) development work for the future global aviation system is analogous to the ongoing development of the IOOS. Further, there have been important practical lessons on elements of advocacy, and related coalitions of stakeholders, which support successful outcomes. During 2005, an initial spiral development and demonstration project was conducted by a government and industry team applying a NEO, system-of-systems approach to develop the next generation aviation system. Like IOOS, this work was performed in support of an interagency customer set (in this case the Joint Planning and Development Office representing DOT/FAA, DoD, DHS, NASA, DOC/NOAA.) This project explored current and future operational concepts, architecture definition, information exchange requirements, data standards and protocols, and strategic and tactical-level decision support (with special emphasis on timely, data-driven collaborative decision making for complex operational problems.) The next spiral development project will be planned and executed in 2006 and 2007. An important area of early user engagement in the NEO development work was the exploration of a generalized data model to represent the data for a widely diverse future set of data suppliers and users. For the traditional air traffic domain of the baseline system, an important part of this is the Flight Data Object. For the diverse set of interagency and private sector users and for future aviation system concepts, this baseline was an inadequate data representation. Similarly, the NEO project systems engineering and test bed development is related to ongoing work in standards and protocols (including semantics, data structures) for the IOOS. ©2006 IEEE.","2006","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: OCEANS","","","","Standards; Decision making; Decision support systems; Information theory; Systems engineering; Project management; Network architecture; File organization; Data structures; Mathematical models; Computer networks; Aviation; Chlorine compounds; Equipment testing; Industrial engineering; Information Exchange Requirements; Joint network; NASA; Ocean currents; Problem solving; Spiral developments; Unmanned vehicles; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such mediated, networked context, an area that presents considerable development degrees in recent years and uncountable social-cultural, technological challenges is the institutionalization of information processes and/or services in government portals. From this perspective, the present work proposes CAfe-G (Common Architecture for e-Government), a comprehensive web-based framework meant to support interoperability among e-government systems, in order to improve the interaction levels of services provided by governments for their citizens (G2C), to support interaction among different governments (G2G), to assist citizens' requests for government services (C2G), and to enhance the relationship among citizens (C2C). Adaptation concerns are also addressed to support effective CzRM (Citizen Relationship Management). The proposed architecture consists in a bus of services and facilities designed to provide a high level of interoperability through a semantic-driven, upper ontologies-based mechanism for publishing and retrieving of such services and facilities. This approach is aimed to provide virtual spaces and communities for major participation of citizens, thus supplying services integration in order to boost the information exchange among different systems. CAfe-G is CORBA-inspired and it was built over concepts brought from AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) and FOP (Feature-Oriented Programming). CAfe-G presents a feature set to represent Services related to Semantic, Life Events-Driven Presentation or pertinent to Facilities like Mobile, iDTV (Interactive Digital Television) and Trading Services. CAfe-G would help to reduce the bureaucracy, increase the transparency in governmental actions, intensify citizens' digital inclusion, and speed the use of technology up in governmental agencies, through the information interoperability among countries, governments and citizens.","2006","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","170-179","","","","","","","","","","","Academic Conferences Limited info@academic-conferences.org","","English","","","Scopus","","","","Journal Abbreviation: ICEG - 2nd Int.

Semantic Web technologies have the potential to manage the knowledge and coordinate Government-to-Government (G2G) processes. Based on the foundations of Semantic Web, including ontologies, knowledge representation, multi-agent systems and web services; Knowledge Management (KM) and G2G processes, we present a vision for KM for G2G process coordination.

Many of these efforts, however, have focused narrowly on technical hurdles while ignoring the social and political contexts that influence interoperability decisions. This article illustrates how social factors influence interoperability along three axes: classification, ontologies of data models, and government policy. Extant research approaches to interoperability of GIS are discussed and their strengths and weaknesses assessed. The article begins with definitions of what interoperability is, why it is important to academic users and policy makers, and its influence on geographical knowledge in a digital age. Exploration of social influences, as an alternative analytical approach to interoperability, begins with a discussion of the roles of classification and scale. The dangers of maintaining inflexible ontologies associated with specific data models are illustrated as a technical limitation with profound social implications for the construction of knowledge. Finally, policy at the multiple levels of governance with respect to interoperability is explored as an infrastructural constraint - and a diminishing influence.","2005","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","47-61","","4","40","","Cartographica","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","","","","","","","Interoperability; Semantic interoperability; GIS; Data standardization; perception; social theory; Spatial databases; LR_Query: Scopus_02; LR_SearchDate: 2026-01-17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigates the composition of web services and how to effectively employ web services in the design activities. Objectives of this work are twofold. Firstly, to proposes a new technique that assists users to resolve a mismatch in the composition of web services. Secondly, to implement, validate, and evaluate the proposed technique within the context of design activities thus establishing a workbench called Service Oriented Design Activities (SODA). SODA provides a web-based design infrastructure that allows loosely coupled design teams to collaborate on different services, and to enable them to resolve any mismatch between heterogeneous design services.

Consequently, the necessity of establishing a government knowledge management system, so as to speed up information lookups, sharing, and linkups, naturally arises. Moreover, this knowledge management system would in turn enhance e-government effectiveness as it helps to store and transmit information, be it explicit or implicit in nature. The first step in creating this knowledge management system is to build up the government ontology and thesaurus. Upon the completion of the ontology and thesaurus needed, semantic searching can be conducted, which in turn kickstarts other mechanisms required for effective information management. Our research team has been commissioned by the Executive Yuan of Taiwan to establish the draft of government ontology and thesaurus and to design a framework for multiple-layered information management systems upon which the ontology and thesaurus can be constructed.

According to a report from Computer Economics in 1999, 54% of Internet users are English speakers (""English Will Dominate Web for Only Three More Years,"" Computer Economics, July 9, 1999, http://www.computereconomics.com/new4/pr/pr990610.html). However, it is predicted that there will be only 60% increase in Internet users among English speakers verses a 150% growth among non-English speakers for the next five years. By 2005, 57% of Internet users will be non-English speakers. A report by CNN.com in 2000 showed that the number of Internet users in China had been increased from 8.9 million to 16.9 million from January to June in 2000 (""Report: China Internet users double to 17 million,"" CNN.com, July, 2000, http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/china.internet.reut/index.html). According to Nielsen/NetRatings, there was a dramatic leap from 22.5 millions to 56.6 millions Internet users from 2001 to 2002. China had become the second largest global at-home Internet population in 2002 (US's Internet population was 166 millions) (Robyn Greenspan, ""China Pulls Ahead of Japan,"" Internet.com, April 22, 2002, http://cyberatlas.internet.com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,,5911_1013841,0 0.html). All of the evidences reveal the importance of crosslingual research to satisfy the needs in the near future. Digital library research has been focusing in structural and semantic interoperability in the past. Searching and retrieving objects across variations in protocols, formats and disciplines are widely explored (Schatz, B., & Chen, H. (1999). Digital libraries: technological advances and social impacts. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, February, 32(2), 45-50.; Chen, H., Yen, J., & Yang, C.C. (1999). International activities: development of Asian digital libraries. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital Libraries, 32(2), 48-49). However, research in crossing language boundaries, especially across European languages and Oriental languages, is still in the initial stage. In this proposal, we put our focus on cross-lingual semantic interoperability by developing automatic generation of a cross-lingual thesaurus based on English/Chinese parallel corpus. When the searchers encounter retrieval problems, professional librarians usually consult the thesaurus to identify other relevant vocabularies. In the problem of searching across language boundaries, a cross-lingual thesaurus, which is generated by co-occurrence analysis and Hopfield network, can be used to generate additional semantically relevant terms that cannot be obtained from dictionary. In particular, the automatically generated cross-lingual thesaurus is able to capture the unknown words that do not exist in a dictionary, such as names of persons, organizations, and events. Due to Hong Kong's unique history background, both English and Chinese are used as official languages in all legal documents. Therefore, English/Chinese cross-lingual information retrieval is critical for applications in courts and the government. In this paper, we develop an automatic thesaurus by the Hopfield network based on a parallel corpus collected from the Web site of the Department of Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Experiments are conducted to measure the precision and recall of the automatic generated English/Chinese thesaurus. The result shows that such thesaurus is a promising tool to retrieve relevant terms, especially in the language that is not the same as the input term. The direct translation of the input term can also be retrieved in most of the cases.","2003","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","671-682","","7","54","","J. Am. Soc. Inf. Sci.

It is part of a broader rubric of interoperability or the ability to share geographic information across multiple platforms and contexts. GIScience researchers have made considerable progress towards understanding and addressing the multiple challenges involved in achieving interoperability. For local government agencies interested in sharing spatial data, however, current interoperability approaches based on object-oriented data models represent idealistic solutions to problems of semantic heterogeneity that often exceed the level of sophistication and funding available. They are waiting for the market to decide how interoperability should be resolved. In order to assist in this transition, this paper presents a rule-based Visual Basic application to standardize the semantics of simple spatial entities using several classification systems. We use the example of well-log data, and argue that this approach enables agencies to share and structure data effectively in an interim period during which market and research standards for semantic interoperability are being determined. It contributes to a geospatial data infrastructure, while allowing agencies to share spatial data in a manner consistent with their level of expertise and existing data structures.","2002","2026-01-17 07:02:49","2026-01-17 07:09:03","","343-354","","4","29","","Cartogr.
